<h2>LORD ARTHUR SAVILE&rsquo;S CRIME</h2>
<p class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></p>
<p>It was Lady Windermere&rsquo;s last reception before Easter, and
Bentinck House was even more crowded than usual.&nbsp; Six Cabinet Ministers
had come on from the Speaker&rsquo;s Lev&eacute;e in their stars and
ribands, all the pretty women wore their smartest dresses, and at the
end of the picture-gallery stood the Princess Sophia of Carlsr&uuml;he,
a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny black eyes and wonderful emeralds,
talking bad French at the top of her voice, and laughing immoderately
at everything that was said to her.&nbsp; It was certainly a wonderful
medley of people.&nbsp; Gorgeous peeresses chatted affably to violent
Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with eminent sceptics,
a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout prima-donna from room
to room, on the staircase stood several Royal Academicians, disguised
as artists, and it was said that at one time the supper-room was absolutely
crammed with geniuses.&nbsp; In fact, it was one of Lady Windermere&rsquo;s
best nights, and the Princess stayed till nearly half-past eleven.</p>
<p>As soon as she had gone, Lady Windermere returned to the picture-gallery,
where a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the scientific
theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from Hungary, and began to
talk to the Duchess of Paisley.&nbsp; She looked wonderfully beautiful
with her grand ivory throat, her large blue forget-me-not eyes, and
her heavy coils of golden hair.&nbsp; <i>Or pur</i> they were - not
that pale straw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold,
but such gold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber;
and they gave to her face something of the frame of a saint, with not
a little of the fascination of a sinner.&nbsp; She was a curious psychological
study.&nbsp; Early in life she had discovered the important truth that
nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion; and by a series
of reckless escapades, half of them quite harmless, she had acquired
all the privileges of a personality.&nbsp; She had more than once changed
her husband; indeed, Debrett credits her with three marriages; but as
she had never changed her lover, the world had long ago ceased to talk
scandal about her.&nbsp; She was now forty years of age, childless,
and with that inordinate passion for pleasure which is the secret of
remaining young.</p>
<p>Suddenly she looked eagerly round the room, and said, in her clear
contralto voice, &lsquo;Where is my cheiromantist?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your what, Gladys?&rsquo; exclaimed the Duchess, giving an
involuntary start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cheiromantist, Duchess; I can&rsquo;t live without him
at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Gladys! you are always so original,&rsquo; murmured the
Duchess, trying to remember what a cheiromantist really was, and hoping
it was not the same as a cheiropodist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He comes to see my hand twice a week regularly,&rsquo; continued
Lady Windermere, &lsquo;and is most interesting about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; said the Duchess to herself, &lsquo;he
is a sort of cheiropodist after all.&nbsp; How very dreadful.&nbsp;
I hope he is a foreigner at any rate.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be quite
so bad then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must certainly introduce him to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Introduce him!&rsquo; cried the Duchess; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
mean to say he is here?&rsquo; and she began looking about for a small
tortoise-shell fan and a very tattered lace shawl, so as to be ready
to go at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course he is here; I would not dream of giving a party
without him.&nbsp; He tells me I have a pure psychic hand, and that
if my thumb had been the least little bit shorter, I should have been
a confirmed pessimist, and gone into a convent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I see!&rsquo; said the Duchess, feeling very much relieved;
&lsquo;he tells fortunes, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And misfortunes, too,&rsquo; answered Lady Windermere, &lsquo;any
amount of them.&nbsp; Next year, for instance, I am in great danger,
both by land and sea, so I am going to live in a balloon, and draw up
my dinner in a basket every evening.&nbsp; It is all written down on
my little finger, or on the palm of my hand, I forget which.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely that is tempting Providence, Gladys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Duchess, surely Providence can resist temptation by
this time.&nbsp; I think every one should have their hands told once
a month, so as to know what not to do.&nbsp; Of course, one does it
all the same, but it is so pleasant to be warned.&nbsp; Now if some
one doesn&rsquo;t go and fetch Mr. Podgers at once, I shall have to
go myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go, Lady Windermere,&rsquo; said a tall handsome young
man, who was standing by, listening to the conversation with an amused
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks so much, Lord Arthur; but I am afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t
recognise him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he is as wonderful as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn&rsquo;t
well miss him.&nbsp; Tell me what he is like, and I&rsquo;ll bring him
to you at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he is not a bit like a cheiromantist.&nbsp; I mean he
is not mysterious, or esoteric, or romantic-looking.&nbsp; He is a little,
stout man, with a funny, bald head, and great gold-rimmed spectacles;
something between a family doctor and a country attorney.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
really very sorry, but it is not my fault.&nbsp; People are so annoying.&nbsp;
All my pianists look exactly like poets, and all my poets look exactly
like pianists; and I remember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator
to dinner, a man who had blown up ever so many people, and always wore
a coat of mail, and carried a dagger up his shirt-sleeve; and do you
know that when he came he looked just like a nice old clergyman, and
cracked jokes all the evening?&nbsp; Of course, he was very amusing,
and all that, but I was awfully disappointed; and when I asked him about
the coat of mail, he only laughed, and said it was far too cold to wear
in England.&nbsp; Ah, here is Mr. Podgers!&nbsp; Now, Mr. Podgers, I
want you to tell the Duchess of Paisley&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Duchess,
you must take your glove off.&nbsp; No, not the left hand, the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Gladys, I really don&rsquo;t think it is quite right,&rsquo;
said the Duchess, feebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing interesting ever is,&rsquo; said Lady Windermere:
&lsquo;<i>on a fait le monde ainsi</i>.&nbsp; But I must introduce you.&nbsp;
Duchess, this is Mr. Podgers, my pet cheiromantist.&nbsp; Mr. Podgers,
this is the Duchess of Paisley, and if you say that she has a larger
mountain of the moon than I have, I will never believe in you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, Gladys, there is nothing of the kind in my hand,&rsquo;
said the Duchess gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Grace is quite right,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers, glancing
at the little fat hand with its short square fingers, &lsquo;the mountain
of the moon is not developed.&nbsp; The line of life, however, is excellent.&nbsp;
Kindly bend the wrist.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Three distinct lines on
the <i>rascette</i>!&nbsp; You will live to a great age, Duchess, and
be extremely happy.&nbsp; Ambition - very moderate, line of intellect
not exaggerated, line of heart - &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, do be indiscreet, Mr. Podgers,&rsquo; cried Lady Windermere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers,
bowing, &lsquo;if the Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that
I see great permanence of affection, combined with a strong sense of
duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray go on, Mr. Podgers,&rsquo; said the Duchess, looking
quite pleased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Economy is not the least of your Grace&rsquo;s virtues,&rsquo;
continued Mr. Podgers, and Lady Windermere went off into fits of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Economy is a very good thing,&rsquo; remarked the Duchess
complacently; &lsquo;when I married Paisley he had eleven castles, and
not a single house fit to live in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now he has twelve houses, and not a single castle,&rsquo;
cried Lady Windermere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said the Duchess, &lsquo;I like - &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comfort,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers, &lsquo;and modern improvements,
and hot water laid on in every bedroom.&nbsp; Your Grace is quite right.&nbsp;
Comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have told the Duchess&rsquo;s character admirably, Mr.
Podgers, and now you must tell Lady Flora&rsquo;s&rsquo;; and in answer
to a nod from the smiling hostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair,
and high shoulder-blades, stepped awkwardly from behind the sofa, and
held out a long, bony hand with spatulate fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, a pianist! I see,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers, &lsquo;an excellent
pianist, but perhaps hardly a musician.&nbsp; Very reserved, very honest,
and with a great love of animals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite true!&rsquo; exclaimed the Duchess, turning to Lady
Windermere, &lsquo;absolutely true!&nbsp; Flora keeps two dozen collie
dogs at Macloskie, and would turn our town house into a menagerie if
her father would let her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that is just what I do with my house every Thursday
evening,&rsquo; cried Lady Windermere, laughing, &lsquo;only I like
lions better than collie dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your one mistake, Lady Windermere,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers,
with a pompous bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a woman can&rsquo;t make her mistakes charming, she is
only a female,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you must read
some more hands for us.&nbsp; Come, Sir Thomas, show Mr. Podgers yours&rsquo;;
and a genial-looking old gentleman, in a white waistcoat, came forward,
and held out a thick rugged hand, with a very long third finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An adventurous nature; four long voyages in the past, and
one to come.&nbsp; Been ship-wrecked three times.&nbsp; No, only twice,
but in danger of a shipwreck your next journey.&nbsp; A strong Conservative,
very punctual, and with a passion for collecting curiosities.&nbsp;
Had a severe illness between the ages sixteen and eighteen.&nbsp; Was
left a fortune when about thirty.&nbsp; Great aversion to cats and Radicals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Extraordinary!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Thomas; &lsquo;you must
really tell my wife&rsquo;s hand, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your second wife&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers quietly,
still keeping Sir Thomas&rsquo;s hand in his.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your second
wife&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I shall be charmed&rsquo;; but Lady Marvel, a melancholy-looking
woman, with brown hair and sentimental eyelashes, entirely declined
to have her past or her future exposed; and nothing that Lady Windermere
could do would induce Monsieur de Koloff, the Russian Ambassador, even
to take his gloves off.&nbsp; In fact, many people seemed afraid to
face the odd little man with his stereotyped smile, his gold spectacles,
and his bright, beady eyes; and when he told poor Lady Fermor, right
out before every one, that she did not care a bit for music, but was
extremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt that cheiromancy
was a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to be encouraged,
except in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</i></p>
<p>Lord Arthur Savile, however, who did not know anything about Lady
Fermor&rsquo;s unfortunate story, and who had been watching Mr. Podgers
with a great deal of interest, was filled with an immense curiosity
to have his own hand read, and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself
forward, crossed over the room to where Lady Windermere was sitting,
and, with a charming blush, asked her if she thought Mr. Podgers would
mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, he won&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; said Lady Windermere,
&lsquo;that is what he is here for.&nbsp; All my lions, Lord Arthur,
are performing lions, and jump through hoops whenever I ask them.&nbsp;
But I must warn you beforehand that I shall tell Sybil everything.&nbsp;
She is coming to lunch with me to-morrow, to talk about bonnets, and
if Mr. Podgers finds out that you have a bad temper, or a tendency to
gout, or a wife living in Bayswater, I shall certainly let her know
all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur smiled, and shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not afraid,&rsquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sybil knows me as well as I know her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I am a little sorry to hear you say that.&nbsp;
The proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding.&nbsp; No,
I am not at all cynical, I have merely got experience, which, however,
is very much the same thing.&nbsp; Mr. Podgers, Lord Arthur Savile is
dying to have his hand read.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell him that he is engaged
to one of the most beautiful girls in London, because that appeared
in the <i>Morning Post</i> a month ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lady Windermere,&rsquo; cried the Marchioness of Jedburgh,
&lsquo;do let Mr. Podgers stay here a little longer.&nbsp; He has just
told me I should go on the stage, and I am so interested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he has told you that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall certainly
take him away.&nbsp; Come over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur&rsquo;s
hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Lady Jedburgh, making a little <i>moue</i>
as she rose from the sofa, &lsquo;if I am not to be allowed to go on
the stage, I must be allowed to be part of the audience at any rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course; we are all going to be part of the audience,&rsquo;
said Lady Windermere; &lsquo;and now, Mr. Podgers, be sure and tell
us something nice.&nbsp; Lord Arthur is one of my special favourites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur&rsquo;s hand he grew curiously
pale, and said nothing.&nbsp; A shudder seemed to pass through him,
and his great bushy eyebrows twitched convulsively, in an odd, irritating
way they had when he was puzzled.&nbsp; Then some huge beads of perspiration
broke out on his yellow forehead, like a poisonous dew, and his fat
fingers grew cold and clammy.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation,
and, for the first time in his life, he himself felt fear.&nbsp; His
impulse was to rush from the room, but he restrained himself.&nbsp;
It was better to know the worst, whatever it was, than to be left in
this hideous uncertainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am waiting, Mr. Podgers,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are all waiting,&rsquo; cried Lady Windermere, in her quick,
impatient manner, but the cheiromantist made no reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe Arthur is going on the stage,&rsquo; said Lady Jedburgh,
&lsquo;and that, after your scolding, Mr. Podgers is afraid to tell
him so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Podgers dropped Lord Arthur&rsquo;s right hand, and
seized hold of his left, bending down so low to examine it that the
gold rims of his spectacles seemed almost to touch the palm.&nbsp; For
a moment his face became a white mask of horror, but he soon recovered
his <i>sang-froid</i>, and looking up at Lady Windermere, said with
a forced smile, &lsquo;It is the hand of a charming young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is!&rsquo; answered Lady Windermere, &lsquo;but
will he be a charming husband?&nbsp; That is what I want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All charming young men are,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think a husband should be too fascinating,&rsquo;
murmured Lady Jedburgh pensively, &lsquo;it is so dangerous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear child, they never are too fascinating,&rsquo; cried
Lady Windermere.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what I want are details.&nbsp; Details
are the only things that interest.&nbsp; What is going to happen to
Lord Arthur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, within the next few months Lord Arthur will go a voyage
- &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, his honeymoon, of course!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And lose a relative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not his sister, I hope?&rsquo; said Lady Jedburgh, in a piteous
tone of voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not his sister,&rsquo; answered Mr. Podgers, with
a deprecating wave of the hand, &lsquo;a distant relative merely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am dreadfully disappointed,&rsquo; said Lady Windermere.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have absolutely nothing to tell Sybil to-morrow.&nbsp; No one
cares about distant relatives nowadays.&nbsp; They went out of fashion
years ago.&nbsp; However, I suppose she had better have a black silk
by her; it always does for church, you know.&nbsp; And now let us go
to supper.&nbsp; They are sure to have eaten everything up, but we may
find some hot soup.&nbsp; Fran&ccedil;ois used to make excellent soup
once, but he is so agitated about politics at present, that I never
feel quite certain about him.&nbsp; I do wish General Boulanger would
keep quiet.&nbsp; Duchess, I am sure you are tired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, dear Gladys,&rsquo; answered the Duchess, waddling
towards the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have enjoyed myself immensely, and
the cheiropodist, I mean the cheiromantist, is most interesting.&nbsp;
Flora, where can my tortoise-shell fan be?&nbsp; Oh, thank you, Sir
Thomas, so much.&nbsp; And my lace shawl, Flora?&nbsp; Oh, thank you,
Sir Thomas, very kind, I&rsquo;m sure&rsquo;; and the worthy creature
finally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scent-bottle
more than twice.</p>
<p>All this time Lord Arthur Savile had remained standing by the fireplace,
with the same feeling of dread over him, the same sickening sense of
coming evil.&nbsp; He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past
him on Lord Plymdale&rsquo;s arm, looking lovely in her pink brocade
and pearls, and he hardly heard Lady Windermere when she called to him
to follow her.&nbsp; He thought of Sybil Merton, and the idea that anything
could come between them made his eyes dim with tears.</p>
<p>Looking at him, one would have said that Nemesis had stolen the shield
of Pallas, and shown him the Gorgon&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; He seemed turned
to stone, and his face was like marble in its melancholy.&nbsp; He had
lived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune,
a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care, its beautiful boyish
insouciance; and now for the first time he became conscious of the terrible
mystery of Destiny, of the awful meaning of Doom.</p>
<p>How mad and monstrous it all seemed!&nbsp; Could it be that written
on his hand, in characters that he could not read himself, but that
another could decipher, was some fearful secret of sin, some blood-red
sign of crime?&nbsp; Was there no escape possible?&nbsp; Were we no
better than chessmen, moved by an unseen power, vessels the potter fashions
at his fancy, for honour or for shame?&nbsp; His reason revolted against
it, and yet he felt that some tragedy was hanging over him, and that
he had been suddenly called upon to bear an intolerable burden.&nbsp;
Actors are so fortunate.&nbsp; They can choose whether they will appear
in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh
or shed tears.&nbsp; But in real life it is different.&nbsp; Most men
and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications.&nbsp;
Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like
Prince Hal.&nbsp; The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Podgers entered the room.&nbsp; When he saw Lord Arthur
he started, and his coarse, fat face became a sort of greenish-yellow
colour.&nbsp; The two men&rsquo;s eyes met, and for a moment there was
silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Duchess has left one of her gloves here, Lord Arthur,
and has asked me to bring it to her,&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers finally.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah, I see it on the sofa!&nbsp; Good evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Podgers, I must insist on your giving me a straightforward
answer to a question I am going to put to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another time, Lord Arthur, but the Duchess is anxious.&nbsp;
I am afraid I must go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall not go.&nbsp; The Duchess is in no hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladies should not be kept waiting, Lord Arthur,&rsquo; said
Mr. Podgers, with his sickly smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fair sex is apt
to be impatient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur&rsquo;s finely-chiselled lips curled in petulant disdain.&nbsp;
The poor Duchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment.&nbsp;
He walked across the room to where Mr. Podgers was standing, and held
his hand out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me what you saw there,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
me the truth.&nbsp; I must know it.&nbsp; I am not a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Podgers&rsquo;s eyes blinked behind his gold-rimmed spectacles,
and he moved uneasily from one foot to the other, while his fingers
played nervously with a flash watch-chain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you think that I saw anything in your hand, Lord
Arthur, more than I told you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you did, and I insist on your telling me what it was.&nbsp;
I will pay you.&nbsp; I will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The green eyes flashed for a moment, and then became dull again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guineas?&rsquo; said Mr. Podgers at last, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; I will send you a cheque to-morrow.&nbsp;
What is your club?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no club.&nbsp; That is to say, not just at present.&nbsp;
My address is -, but allow me to give you my card&rsquo;; and producing
a bit of gilt-edge pasteboard from his waistcoat pocket, Mr. Podgers
handed it, with a low bow, to Lord Arthur, who read on it,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p><i>Mr.&nbsp; SEPTIMUS R. PODGERS<br />Professional Cheiromantist<br /></i>103<i>a
West Moon Street</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;My hours are from ten to four,&rsquo; murmured Mr. Podgers
mechanically, &lsquo;and I make a reduction for families.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be quick,&rsquo; cried Lord Arthur, looking very pale, and
holding his hand out.</p>
<p>Mr. Podgers glanced nervously round, and drew the heavy <i>porti&egrave;re</i>
across the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will take a little time, Lord Arthur, you had better sit
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be quick, sir,&rsquo; cried Lord Arthur again, stamping his
foot angrily on the polished floor.</p>
<p>Mr. Podgers smiled, drew from his breast-pocket a small magnifying
glass, and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite ready,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ten minutes later, with face blanched by terror, and eyes wild with
grief, Lord Arthur Savile rushed from Bentinck House, crushing his way
through the crowd of fur-coated footmen that stood round the large striped
awning, and seeming not to see or hear anything.&nbsp; The night was
bitter cold, and the gas-lamps round the square flared and flickered
in the keen wind; but his hands were hot with fever, and his forehead
burned like fire.&nbsp; On and on he went, almost with the gait of a
drunken man.&nbsp; A policeman looked curiously at him as he passed,
and a beggar, who slouched from an archway to ask for alms, grew frightened,
seeing misery greater than his own.&nbsp; Once he stopped under a lamp,
and looked at his hands.&nbsp; He thought he could detect the stain
of blood already upon them, and a faint cry broke from his trembling
lips.</p>
<p>Murder! that is what the cheiromantist had seen there.&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp;
The very night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in
his ear.&nbsp; The dark corners of the streets were full of it.&nbsp;
It grinned at him from the roofs of the houses.</p>
<p>First he came to the Park, whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate
him.&nbsp; He leaned wearily up against the railings, cooling his brow
against the wet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of the
trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;Murder! murder!&rsquo; he kept repeating, as though
iteration could dim the horror of the word.&nbsp; The sound of his own
voice made him shudder, yet he almost hoped that Echo might hear him,
and wake the slumbering city from its dreams.&nbsp; He felt a mad desire
to stop the casual passer-by, and tell him everything.</p>
<p>Then he wandered across Oxford Street into narrow, shameful alleys.&nbsp;
Two women with painted faces mocked at him as he went by.&nbsp; From
a dark courtyard came a sound of oaths and blows, followed by shrill
screams, and, huddled upon a damp door-step, he saw the crook-backed
forms of poverty and eld.&nbsp; A strange pity came over him.&nbsp;
Were these children of sin and misery predestined to their end, as he
to his?&nbsp; Were they, like him, merely the puppets of a monstrous
show?</p>
<p>And yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering that
struck him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning.&nbsp;
How incoherent everything seemed!&nbsp; How lacking in all harmony!&nbsp;
He was amazed at the discord between the shallow optimism of the day,
and the real facts of existence.&nbsp; He was still very young.</p>
<p>After a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church.&nbsp;
The silent roadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, flecked
here and there by the dark arabesques of waving shadows.&nbsp; Far into
the distance curved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside a
little walled-in house stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleep inside.&nbsp;
He walked hastily in the direction of Portland Place, now and then looking
round, as though he feared that he was being followed.&nbsp; At the
corner of Rich Street stood two men, reading a small bill upon a hoarding.&nbsp;
An odd feeling of curiosity stirred him, and he crossed over.&nbsp;
As he came near, the word &lsquo;Murder,&rsquo; printed in black letters,
met his eye.&nbsp; He started, and a deep flush came into his cheek.&nbsp;
It was an advertisement offering a reward for any information leading
to the arrest of a man of medium height, between thirty and forty years
of age, wearing a billy-cock hat, a black coat, and check trousers,
and with a scar upon his right cheek.&nbsp; He read it over and over
again, and wondered if the wretched man would be caught, and how he
had been scarred.&nbsp; Perhaps, some day, his own name might be placarded
on the walls of London.&nbsp; Some day, perhaps, a price would be set
on his head also.</p>
<p>The thought made him sick with horror.&nbsp; He turned on his heel,
and hurried on into the night.</p>
<p>Where he went he hardly knew.&nbsp; He had a dim memory of wandering
through a labyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of
sombre streets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last
in Piccadilly Circus.&nbsp; As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square,
he met the great waggons on their way to Covent Garden.&nbsp; The white-smocked
carters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode
sturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each
other; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team,
sat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping
tight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the
great piles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning
sky, like masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous
rose.&nbsp; Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why.&nbsp;
There was something in the dawn&rsquo;s delicate loveliness that seemed
to him inexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break
in beauty, and that set in storm.&nbsp; These rustics, too, with their
rough, good-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange
London they saw!&nbsp; A London free from the sin of night and the smoke
of day, a pallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs!&nbsp; He
wondered what they thought of it, and whether they knew anything of
its splendour and its shame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and
its horrible hunger, of all it makes and mars from morn to eve.&nbsp;
Probably it was to them merely a mart where they brought their fruits
to sell, and where they tarried for a few hours at most, leaving the
streets still silent, the houses still asleep.&nbsp; It gave him pleasure
to watch them as they went by.&nbsp; Rude as they were, with their heavy,
hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait, they brought a little of a
ready with them.&nbsp; He felt that they had lived with Nature, and
that she had taught them peace.&nbsp; He envied them all that they did
not know.</p>
<p>By the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue,
and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When Lord Arthur woke it was twelve o&rsquo;clock, and the midday
sun was streaming through the ivory-silk curtains of his room.&nbsp;
He got up and looked out of the window.&nbsp; A dim haze of heat was
hanging over the great city, and the roofs of the houses were like dull
silver.&nbsp; In the flickering green of the square below some children
were flitting about like white butterflies, and the pavement was crowded
with people on their way to the Park.&nbsp; Never had life seemed lovelier
to him, never had the things of evil seemed more remote.</p>
<p>Then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray.&nbsp; After
he had drunk it, he drew aside a heavy <i>porti&egrave;re</i> of peach-coloured
plush, and passed into the bathroom.&nbsp; The light stole softly from
above, through thin slabs of transparent onyx, and the water in the
marble tank glimmered like a moonstone.&nbsp; He plunged hastily in,
till the cool ripples touched throat and hair, and then dipped his head
right under, as though he would have wiped away the stain of some shameful
memory.&nbsp; When he stepped out he felt almost at peace.&nbsp; The
exquisite physical conditions of the moment had dominated him, as indeed
often happens in the case of very finely-wrought natures, for the senses,
like fire, can purify as well as destroy.</p>
<p>After breakfast, he flung himself down on a divan, and lit a cigarette.&nbsp;
On the mantel-shelf, framed in dainty old brocade, stood a large photograph
of Sybil Merton, as he had seen her first at Lady Noel&rsquo;s ball.&nbsp;
The small, exquisitely-shaped head drooped slightly to one side, as
though the thin, reed-like throat could hardly bear the burden of so
much beauty; the lips were slightly parted, and seemed made for sweet
music; and all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from
the dreaming eyes.&nbsp; With her soft, clinging dress of <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>-<i>de-chine</i>,
and her large leaf-shaped fan, she looked like one of those delicate
little figures men find in the olive-woods near Tanagra; and there was
a touch of Greek grace in her pose and attitude.&nbsp; Yet she was not
<i>petite</i>.&nbsp; She was simply perfectly proportioned - a rare
thing in an age when so many women are either over life-size or insignificant.</p>
<p>Now as Lord Arthur looked at her, he was filled with the terrible
pity that is born of love.&nbsp; He felt that to marry her, with the
doom of murder hanging over his head, would be a betrayal like that
of Judas, a sin worse than any the Borgia had ever dreamed of.&nbsp;
What happiness could there be for them, when at any moment he might
be called upon to carry out the awful prophecy written in his hand?&nbsp;
What manner of life would be theirs while Fate still held this fearful
fortune in the scales?&nbsp; The marriage must be postponed, at all
costs.&nbsp; Of this he was quite resolved.&nbsp; Ardently though he
loved the girl, and the mere touch of her fingers, when they sat together,
made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite joy, he recognised
none the less clearly where his duty lay, and was fully conscious of
the fact that he had no right to marry until he had committed the murder.&nbsp;
This done, he could stand before the altar with Sybil Merton, and give
his life into her hands without terror of wrongdoing.&nbsp; This done,
he could take her to his arms, knowing that she would never have to
blush for him, never have to hang her head in shame.&nbsp; But done
it must be first; and the sooner the better for both.</p>
<p>Many men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of
dalliance to the steep heights of duty; but Lord Arthur was too conscientious
to set pleasure above principle.&nbsp; There was more than mere passion
in his love; and Sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good and noble.&nbsp;
For a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was asked to
do, but it soon passed away.&nbsp; His heart told him that it was not
a sin, but a sacrifice; his reason reminded him that there was no other
course open.&nbsp; He had to choose between living for himself and living
for others, and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was,
yet he knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love.&nbsp;
Sooner or later we are all called upon to decide on the same issue -
of us all, the same question is asked.&nbsp; To Lord Arthur it came
early in life - before his nature had been spoiled by the calculating
cynicism of middle-age, or his heart corroded by the shallow, fashionable
egotism of our day, and he felt no hesitation about doing his duty.&nbsp;
Fortunately also, for him, he was no mere dreamer, or idle dilettante.&nbsp;
Had he been so, he would have hesitated, like Hamlet, and let irresolution
mar his purpose.&nbsp; But he was essentially practical.&nbsp; Life
to him meant action, rather than thought.&nbsp; He had that rarest of
all things, common sense.</p>
<p>The wild, turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time
completely passed away, and it was almost with a sense of shame that
he looked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street, his fierce
emotional agony.&nbsp; The very sincerity of his sufferings made them
seem unreal to him now.&nbsp; He wondered how he could have been so
foolish as to rant and rave about the inevitable.&nbsp; The only question
that seemed to trouble him was, whom to make away with; for he was not
blind to the fact that murder, like the religions of the Pagan world,
requires a victim as well as a priest.&nbsp; Not being a genius, he
had no enemies, and indeed he felt that this was not the time for the
gratification of any personal pique or dislike, the mission in which
he was engaged being one of great and grave solemnity.&nbsp; He accordingly
made out a list of his friends and relatives on a sheet of notepaper,
and after careful consideration, decided in favour of Lady Clementina
Beauchamp, a dear old lady who lived in Curzon Street, and was his own
second cousin by his mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He had always been very
fond of Lady Clem, as every one called her, and as he was very wealthy
himself, having come into all Lord Rugby&rsquo;s property when he came
of age, there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar monetary
advantage by her death.&nbsp; In fact, the more he thought over the
matter, the more she seemed to him to be just the right person, and,
feeling that any delay would be unfair to Sybil, he determined to make
his arrangements at once.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done was, of course, to settle with the cheiromantist;
so he sat down at a small Sheraton writing-table that stood near the
window, drew a cheque for &pound;105, payable to the order of Mr. Septimus
Podgers, and, enclosing it in an envelope, told his valet to take it
to West Moon Street.&nbsp; He then telephoned to the stables for his
hansom, and dressed to go out.&nbsp; As he was leaving the room he looked
back at Sybil Merton&rsquo;s photograph, and swore that, come what may,
he would never let her know what he was doing for her sake, but would
keep the secret of his self-sacrifice hidden always in his heart.</p>
<p>On his way to the Buckingham, he stopped at a florist&rsquo;s, and
sent Sybil a beautiful basket of narcissus, with lovely white petals
and staring pheasants&rsquo; eyes, and on arriving at the club, went
straight to the library, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring
him a lemon-and-soda, and a book on Toxicology.&nbsp; He had fully decided
that poison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business.&nbsp;
Anything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him, and
besides, he was very anxious not to murder Lady Clementina in any way
that might attract public attention, as he hated the idea of being lionised
at Lady Windermere&rsquo;s, or seeing his name figuring in the paragraphs
of vulgar society - newspapers.&nbsp; He had also to think of Sybil&rsquo;s
father and mother, who were rather old-fashioned people, and might possibly
object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal, though
he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case they
would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated
him.&nbsp; He had every reason, then, to decide in favour of poison.&nbsp;
It was safe, sure, and quiet, and did away with any necessity for painful
scenes, to which, like most Englishmen, he had a rooted objection.</p>
<p>Of the science of poisons, however, he knew absolutely nothing, and
as the waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but
<i>Ruff&rsquo;s Guide</i> and<i> Bailey&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, he examined
the book-shelves himself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound
edition of the <i>Pharmacopoeia</i>, and a copy of Erskine&rsquo;s <i>Toxicology</i>,
edited by Sir Mathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians,
and one of the oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected
in mistake for somebody else; a <i>contretemps</i> that so enraged the
Committee, that when the real man came up they black-balled him unanimously.&nbsp;
Lord Arthur was a good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both
books, and had begun to regret that he had not paid more attention to
his classics at Oxford, when in the second volume of Erskine, he found
a very interesting and complete account of the properties of aconitine,
written in fairly clear English.&nbsp; It seemed to him to be exactly
the poison he wanted.&nbsp; It was swift - indeed, almost immediate,
in its effect - perfectly painless, and when taken in the form of a
gelatine capsule, the mode recommended by Sir Mathew, not by any means
unpalatable.&nbsp; He accordingly made a note, upon his shirt-cuff,
of the amount necessary for a fatal dose, put the books back in their
places, and strolled up St. James&rsquo;s Street, to Pestle and Humbey&rsquo;s,
the great chemists.&nbsp; Mr. Pestle, who always attended personally
on the aristocracy, was a good deal surprised at the order, and in a
very deferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate
being necessary.&nbsp; However, as soon as Lord Arthur explained to
him that it was for a large Norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to
get rid of, as it showed signs of incipient rabies, and had already
bitten the coachman twice in the calf of the leg, he expressed himself
as being perfectly satisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful
knowledge of Toxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver <i>bonbonni&egrave;re</i>
that he saw in a shop window in Bond Street, threw away Pestle and Hambey&rsquo;s
ugly pill-box, and drove off at once to Lady Clementina&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, <i>monsieur le mauvais sujet</i>,&rsquo; cried the old
lady, as he entered the room, &lsquo;why haven&rsquo;t you been to see
me all this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Lady Clem, I never have a moment to myself,&rsquo;
said Lord Arthur, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you mean that you go about all day long with Miss
Sybil Merton, buying <i>chiffons</i> and talking nonsense?&nbsp; I cannot
understand why people make such a fuss about being married.&nbsp; In
my day we never dreamed of billing and cooing in public, or in private
for that matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you I have not seen Sybil for twenty-four hours,
Lady Clem.&nbsp; As far as I can make out, she belongs entirely to her
milliners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course; that is the only reason you come to see an ugly
old woman like myself.&nbsp; I wonder you men don&rsquo;t take warning.&nbsp;
<i>On a fait des folies pour moi</i>, and here I am, a poor rheumatic
creature, with a false front and a bad temper.&nbsp; Why, if it were
not for dear Lady Jansen, who sends me all the worst French novels she
can find, I don&rsquo;t think I could get through the day.&nbsp; Doctors
are no use at all, except to get fees out of one.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t
even cure my heartburn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,&rsquo; said
Lord Arthur gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a wonderful thing, invented
by an American.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like American inventions, Arthur.&nbsp;
I am quite sure I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I read some American novels lately,
and they were quite nonsensical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but there is no nonsense at all about this, Lady Clem!&nbsp;
I assure you it is a perfect cure.&nbsp; You must promise to try it&rsquo;;
and Lord Arthur brought the little box out of his pocket, and handed
it to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the box is charming, Arthur.&nbsp; Is it really a present?&nbsp;
That is very sweet of you.&nbsp; And is this the wonderful medicine?&nbsp;
It looks like a <i>bonbon</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take it at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&nbsp; Lady Clem,&rsquo; cried Lord Arthur, catching
hold of her hand, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t do anything of the kind.&nbsp;
It is a homoeopathic medicine, and if you take it without having heartburn,
it might do you no end of harm.&nbsp; Wait till you have an attack,
and take it then.&nbsp; You will be astonished at the result.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to take it now,&rsquo; said Lady Clementina,
holding up to the light the little transparent capsule, with its floating
bubble of liquid aconitine.&nbsp; I am sure it is delicious.&nbsp; The
fact is that, though I hate doctors, I love medicines.&nbsp; However,
I&rsquo;ll keep it till my next attack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when will that be?&rsquo; asked Lord Arthur eagerly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will it be soon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not for a week.&nbsp; I had a very bad time yesterday
morning with it.&nbsp; But one never knows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure to have one before the end of the month then,
Lady Clem?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid so.&nbsp; But how sympathetic you are to-day,
Arthur!&nbsp; Really, Sybil has done you a great deal of good.&nbsp;
And now you must run away, for I am dining with some very dull people,
who won&rsquo;t talk scandal, and I know that if I don&rsquo;t get my
sleep now I shall never be able to keep awake during dinner.&nbsp; Good-bye,
Arthur, give my love to Sybil, and thank you so much for the American
medicine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t forget to take it, Lady Clem, will you?&rsquo;
said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t, you silly boy.&nbsp; I think it is
most kind of you to think of me, and I shall write and tell you if I
want any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur left the house in high spirits, and with a feeling of
immense relief.</p>
<p>That night he had an interview with Sybil Merton.&nbsp; He told her
how he had been suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty,
from which neither honour nor duty would allow him to recede.&nbsp;
He told her that the marriage must be put off for the present, as until
he had got rid of his fearful entanglements, he was not a free man.&nbsp;
He implored her to trust him, and not to have any doubts about the future.&nbsp;
Everything would come right, but patience was necessary.</p>
<p>The scene took place in the conservatory of Mr. Merton&rsquo;s house,
in Park Lane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual.&nbsp; Sybil had
never seemed more happy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted
to play the coward&rsquo;s part, to write to Lady Clementina for the
pill, and to let the marriage go on as if there was no such person as
Mr. Podgers in the world.&nbsp; His better nature, however, soon asserted
itself, and even when Sybil flung herself weeping into his arms, he
did not falter.&nbsp; The beauty that stirred his senses had touched
his conscience also.&nbsp; He felt that to wreck so fair a life for
the sake of a few months&rsquo; pleasure would be a wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>He stayed with Sybil till nearly midnight, comforting her and being
comforted in turn, and early the next morning he left for Venice, after
writing a manly, firm letter to Mr. Merton about the necessary postponement
of the marriage.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In Venice he met his brother, Lord Surbiton, who happened to have
come over from Corfu in his yacht.&nbsp; The two young men spent a delightful
fortnight together.&nbsp; In the morning they rode on the Lido, or glided
up and down the green canals in their long black gondola; in the afternoon
they usually entertained visitors on the yacht; and in the evening they
dined at Florian&rsquo;s, and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the Piazza.&nbsp;
Yet somehow Lord Arthur was not happy.&nbsp; Every day he studied the
obituary column in the <i>Times</i>, expecting to see a notice of Lady
Clementina&rsquo;s death, but every day he was disappointed.&nbsp; He
began to be afraid that some accident had happened to her, and often
regretted that he had prevented her taking the aconitine when she had
been so anxious to try its effect.&nbsp; Sybil&rsquo;s letters, too,
though full of love, and trust, and tenderness, were often very sad
in their tone, and sometimes he used to think that he was parted from
her for ever.</p>
<p>After a fortnight Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, and determined
to run down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard that there was some capital
cock-shooting in the Pinetum.&nbsp; Lord Arthur at first refused absolutely
to come, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremely fond, finally persuaded
him that if he stayed at Danieli&rsquo;s by himself he would be moped
to death, and on the morning of the 15th they started, with a strong
nor&rsquo;-east wind blowing, and a rather choppy sea.&nbsp; The sport
was excellent, and the free, open-air life brought the colour back to
Lord Arthur&rsquo;s cheek, but about the 22nd he became anxious about
Lady Clementina, and, in spite of Surbiton&rsquo;s remonstrances, came
back to Venice by train.</p>
<p>As he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps, the proprietor
came forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams.&nbsp; Lord Arthur
snatched them out of his hand, and tore them open.&nbsp; Everything
had been successful.&nbsp; Lady Clementina had died quite suddenly on
the night of the 17th!</p>
<p>His first thought was for Sybil, and he sent her off a telegram announcing
his immediate return to London.&nbsp; He then ordered his valet to pack
his things for the night mail, sent his gondoliers about five times
their proper fare, and ran up to his sitting-room with a light step
and a buoyant heart.&nbsp; There he found three letters waiting for
him.&nbsp; One was from Sybil herself, full of sympathy and condolence.&nbsp;
The others were from his mother, and from Lady Clementina&rsquo;s solicitor.&nbsp;
It seemed that the old lady had dined with the Duchess that very night,
had delighted every one by her wit and <i>esprit</i>, but had gone home
somewhat early, complaining of heartburn.&nbsp; In the morning she was
found dead in her bed, having apparently suffered no pain.&nbsp; Sir
Mathew Reid had been sent for at once, but, of course, there was nothing
to be done, and she was to be buried on the 22nd at Beauchamp Chalcote.&nbsp;
A few days before she died she had made her will, and left Lord Arthur
her little house in Curzon Street, and all her furniture, personal effects,
and pictures, with the exception of her collection of miniatures, which
was to go to her sister, Lady Margaret Rufford, and her amethyst necklace,
which Sybil Merton was to have.&nbsp; The property was not of much value;
but Mr. Mansfield, the solicitor, was extremely anxious for Lord Arthur
to return at once, if possible, as there were a great many bills to
be paid, and Lady Clementina had never kept any regular accounts.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur was very much touched by Lady Clementina&rsquo;s kind
remembrance of him, and felt that Mr. Podgers had a great deal to answer
for.&nbsp; His love of Sybil, however, dominated every other emotion,
and the consciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort.&nbsp;
When he arrived at Charing Cross, he felt perfectly happy.</p>
<p>The Mertons received him very kindly.&nbsp; Sybil made him promise
that he would never again allow anything to come between them, and the
marriage was fixed for the 7th June.&nbsp; Life seemed to him once more
bright and beautiful, and all his old gladness came back to him again.</p>
<p>One day, however, as he was going over the house in Curzon Street,
in company with Lady Clementina&rsquo;s solicitor and Sybil herself,
burning packages of faded letters, and turning out drawers of odd rubbish,
the young girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you found, Sybil?&rsquo; said Lord Arthur, looking
up from his work, and smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This lovely little silver <i>bonbonni&egrave;re</i>, Arthur.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t it quaint and Dutch?&nbsp; Do give it to me!&nbsp; I know
amethysts won&rsquo;t become me till I am over eighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the box that had held the aconitine.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur started, and a faint blush came into his cheek.&nbsp;
He had almost entirely forgotten what he had done, and it seemed to
him a curious coincidence that Sybil, for whose sake he had gone through
all that terrible anxiety, should have been the first to remind him
of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you can have it, Sybil.&nbsp; I gave it to poor
Lady Clem myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! thank you, Arthur; and may I have the <i>bonbon</i> too?&nbsp;
I had no notion that Lady Clementina liked sweets.&nbsp; I thought she
was far too intellectual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur grew deadly pale, and a horrible idea crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Bonbon</i>, Sybil?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo; he said
in a slow, hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is one in it, that is all.&nbsp; It looks quite old
and dusty, and I have not the slightest intention of eating it.&nbsp;
What is the matter, Arthur?&nbsp; How white you look!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur rushed across the room, and seized the box.&nbsp; Inside
it was the amber-coloured capsule, with its poison-bubble.&nbsp; Lady
Clementina had died a natural death after all!</p>
<p>The shock of the discovery was almost too much for him.&nbsp; He
flung the capsule into the fire, and sank on the sofa with a cry of
despair.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement
of the marriage, and Lady Julia, who had already ordered her dress for
the wedding, did all in her power to make Sybil break off the match.&nbsp;
Dearly, however, as Sybil loved her mother, she had given her whole
life into Lord Arthur&rsquo;s hands, and nothing that Lady Julia could
say could make her waver in her faith.&nbsp; As for Lord Arthur himself,
it took him days to get over his terrible disappointment, and for a
time his nerves were completely unstrung.&nbsp; His excellent common
sense, however, soon asserted itself, and his sound, practical mind
did not leave him long in doubt about what to do.&nbsp; Poison having
proved a complete failure, dynamite, or some other form of explosive,
was obviously the proper thing to try.</p>
<p>He accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives,
and, after careful consideration, determined to blow up his uncle, the
Dean of Chichester.&nbsp; The Dean, who was a man of great culture and
learning, was extremely fond of clocks, and had a wonderful collection
of timepieces, ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day,
and it seemed to Lord Arthur that this hobby of the good Dean&rsquo;s
offered him an excellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme.&nbsp;
Where to procure an explosive machine was, of course, quite another
matter.&nbsp; The London Directory gave him no information on the point,
and he felt that there was very little use in going to Scotland Yard
about it, as they never seemed to know anything about the movements
of the dynamite faction till after an explosion had taken place, and
not much even then.</p>
<p>Suddenly he thought of his friend Rouvaloff, a young Russian of very
revolutionary tendencies, whom he had met at Lady Windermere&rsquo;s
in the winter.&nbsp; Count Rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life
of Peter the Great, and to have come over to England for the purpose
of studying the documents relating to that Tsar&rsquo;s residence in
this country as a ship carpenter; but it was generally suspected that
he was a Nihilist agent, and there was no doubt that the Russian Embassy
did not look with any favour upon his presence in London.&nbsp; Lord
Arthur felt that he was just the man for his purpose, and drove down
one morning to his lodgings in Bloomsbury, to ask his advice and assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you are taking up politics seriously?&rsquo; said Count
Rouvaloff, when Lord Arthur had told him the object of his mission;
but Lord Arthur, who hated swagger of any kind, felt bound to admit
to him that he had not the slightest interest in social questions, and
simply wanted the explosive machine for a purely family matter, in which
no one was concerned but himself.</p>
<p>Count Rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement, and
then seeing that he was quite serious, wrote an address on a piece of
paper, initialled it, and handed it to him across the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scotland Yard would give a good deal to know this address,
my dear fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shan&rsquo;t have it,&rsquo; cried Lord Arthur, laughing;
and after shaking the young Russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs,
examined the paper, and told the coachman to drive to Soho Square.</p>
<p>There he dismissed him, and strolled down Greek Street, till he came
to a place called Bayle&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; He passed under the archway,
and found himself in a curious <i>cul-de-sac</i>, that was apparently
occupied by a French Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines
was stretched across from house to house, and there was a flutter of
white linen in the morning air.&nbsp; He walked right to the end, and
knocked at a little green house.&nbsp; After some delay, during which
every window in the court became a blurred mass of peering faces, the
door was opened by a rather rough-looking foreigner, who asked him in
very bad English what his business was.&nbsp; Lord Arthur handed him
the paper Count Rouvaloff had given him.&nbsp; When the man saw it he
bowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very shabby front parlour on the
ground floor, and in a few moments Herr Winckelkopf, as he was called
in England, bustled into the room, with a very wine-stained napkin round
his neck, and a fork in his left hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Count Rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you,&rsquo;
said Lord Arthur, bowing, &lsquo;and I am anxious to have a short interview
with you on a matter of business.&nbsp; My name is Smith, Mr. Robert
Smith, and I want you to supply me with an explosive clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,&rsquo; said the genial little
German, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look so alarmed, it is my
duty to know everybody, and I remember seeing you one evening at Lady
Windermere&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I hope her ladyship is quite well.&nbsp; Do
you mind sitting with me while I finish my breakfast?&nbsp; There is
an excellent <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>, and my friends are kind enough
to say that my Rhine wine is better than any they get at the German
Embassy,&rsquo; and before Lord Arthur had got over his surprise at
being recognised, he found himself seated in the back-room, sipping
the most delicious Marcobr&uuml;nner out of a pale yellow hock-glass
marked with the Imperial monogram, and chatting in the friendliest manner
possible to the famous conspirator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Explosive clocks,&rsquo; said Herr Winckelkopf, &lsquo;are
not very good things for foreign exportation, as, even if they succeed
in passing the Custom House, the train service is so irregular, that
they usually go off before they have reached their proper destination.&nbsp;
If, however, you want one for home use, I can supply you with an excellent
article, and guarantee that you will he satisfied with the result.&nbsp;
May I ask for whom it is intended?&nbsp; If it is for the police, or
for any one connected with Scotland Yard, I am afraid I cannot do anything
for you.&nbsp; The English detectives are really our best friends, and
I have always found that by relying on their stupidity, we can do exactly
what we like.&nbsp; I could not spare one of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; said Lord Arthur, &lsquo;that it has
nothing to do with the police at all.&nbsp; In fact, the clock is intended
for the Dean of Chichester.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&nbsp; I had no idea that you felt so strongly about
religion, Lord Arthur.&nbsp; Few young men do nowadays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you overrate me, Herr Winckelkopf,&rsquo; said
Lord Arthur, blushing.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact is, I really know nothing
about theology.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a purely private matter then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Purely private.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herr Winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders, and left the room, returning
in a few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny,
and a pretty little French clock, surmounted by an ormolu figure of
Liberty trampling on the hydra of Despotism.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur&rsquo;s face brightened up when he saw it.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
is just what I want,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;and now tell me how it
goes off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! there is my secret,&rsquo; answered Herr Winckelkopf,
contemplating his invention with a justifiable look of pride; &lsquo;let
me know when you wish it to explode, and I will set the machine to the
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to-day is Tuesday, and if you could send it off at once
- &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is impossible; I have a great deal of important work
on hand for some friends of mine in Moscow.&nbsp; Still, I might send
it off to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it will be quite time enough!&rsquo; said Lord Arthur
politely, &lsquo;if it is delivered to-morrow night or Thursday morning.&nbsp;
For the moment of the explosion, say Friday at noon exactly.&nbsp; The
Dean is always at home at that hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friday, at noon,&rsquo; repeated Herr Winckelkopf, and he
made a note to that effect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau
near the fireplace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat, &lsquo;pray
let me know how much I am in your debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is such a small matter, Lord Arthur, that I do not care
to make any charge.&nbsp; The dynamite comes to seven and sixpence,
the clock will be three pounds ten, and the carriage about five shillings.&nbsp;
I am only too pleased to oblige any friend of Count Rouvaloff&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your trouble, Herr Winckelkopf?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that is nothing!&nbsp; It is a pleasure to me.&nbsp; I
do not work for money; I live entirely for my art.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur laid down &pound;4, 2s. 6d. on the table, thanked the
little German for his kindness, and, having succeeded in declining an
invitation to meet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the following Saturday,
left the house and went off to the Park.</p>
<p>For the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement,
and on Friday at twelve o&rsquo;clock he drove down to the Buckingham
to wait for news.&nbsp; All the afternoon the stolid hall-porter kept
posting up telegrams from various parts of the country giving the results
of horse-races, the verdicts in divorce suits, the state of the weather,
and the like, while the tape ticked out wearisome details about an all-night
sitting in the House of Commons, and a small panic on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;
At four o&rsquo;clock the evening papers came in, and Lord Arthur disappeared
into the library with the <i>Pall Mall</i>, the <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>,
the <i>Globe</i>, and the <i>Echo</i>, to the immense indignation of
Colonel Goodchild, who wanted to read the reports of a speech he had
delivered that morning at the Mansion House, on the subject of South
African Missions, and the advisability of having black Bishops in every
province, and for some reason or other had a strong prejudice against
the <i>Evening News</i>.&nbsp; None of the papers, however, contained
even the slightest allusion to Chichester, and Lord Arthur felt that
the attempt must have failed.&nbsp; It was a terrible blow to him, and
for a time he was quite unnerved.&nbsp; Herr Winckelkopf, whom he went
to see the next day was full of elaborate apologies, and offered to
supply him with another clock free of charge, or with a case of nitro-glycerine
bombs at cost price.&nbsp; But he had lost all faith in explosives,
and Herr Winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is so adulterated
nowadays, that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure condition.&nbsp;
The little German, however, while admitting that something must have
gone wrong with the machinery, was not without hope that the clock might
still go off, and instanced the case of a barometer that he had once
sent to the military Governor at Odessa, which, though timed to explode
in ten days, had not done so for something like three months.&nbsp;
It was quite true that when it did go off, it merely succeeded in blowing
a housemaid to atoms, the Governor having gone out of town six weeks
before, but at least it showed that dynamite, as a destructive force,
was, when under the control of machinery, a powerful, though a somewhat
unpunctual agent.&nbsp; Lord Arthur was a little consoled by this reflection,
but even here he was destined to disappointment, for two days afterwards,
as he was going upstairs, the Duchess called him into her boudoir, and
showed him a letter she had just received from the Deanery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane writes charming letters,&rsquo; said the Duchess; &lsquo;you
must really read her last.&nbsp; It is quite as good as the novels Mudie
sends us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Arthur seized the letter from her hand.&nbsp; It ran as follows:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>THE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,<br />27<i>th</i> <i>May.</i></p>
<p>My Dearest Aunt,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also
for the gingham.&nbsp; I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their
wanting to wear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and irreligious
nowadays, that it is difficult to make them see that they should not
try and dress like the upper classes.&nbsp; I am sure I don&rsquo;t
know what we are coming to.&nbsp; As papa has often said in his sermons,
we live in an age of unbelief.</p>
<p>We have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa
last Thursday.&nbsp; It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage
paid, and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read
his remarkable sermon, &lsquo;Is Licence Liberty?&rsquo; for on the
top of the clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the
cap of Liberty on her head.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think it very becoming
myself, but papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right.&nbsp;
Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library,
and we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock
struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came
from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off,
and broke her nose on the fender!&nbsp; Maria was quite alarmed, but
it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of laughter,
and even papa was amused.&nbsp; When we examined it, we found it was
a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular hour,
and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went off
whenever you wanted.&nbsp; Papa said it must not remain in the library,
as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom, and
does nothing but have small explosions all day long.&nbsp; Do you think
Arthur would like one for a wedding present?&nbsp; I suppose they are
quite fashionable in London.&nbsp; Papa says they should do a great
deal of good, as they show that Liberty can&rsquo;t last, but must fall
down.&nbsp; Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French
Revolution.&nbsp; How awful it seems!</p>
<p>I have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your most
instructive letter.&nbsp; How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in
their rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming.&nbsp; I must
say it is absurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many
more important things in this world, and in the next.&nbsp; I am so
glad your flowered poplin turned out so well, and that your lace was
not torn.&nbsp; I am wearing my yellow satin, that you so kindly gave
me, at the Bishop&rsquo;s on Wednesday, and think it will look all right.&nbsp;
Would you have bows or not?&nbsp; Jennings says that every one wears
bows now, and that the underskirt should be frilled.&nbsp; Reggie has
just had another explosion, and papa has ordered the clock to be sent
to the stables.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think papa likes it so much as he
did at first, though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty
and ingenious toy.&nbsp; It shows that people read his sermons, and
profit by them.</p>
<p>Papa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite,
and, hoping that Uncle Cecil&rsquo;s gout is better, believe me, dear
aunt, ever your affectionate niece,</p>
<p>JANE PERCY.</p>
<p>PS. - Do tell me about the bows.&nbsp; Jennings insists they are
the fashion.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Lord Arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter, that the
Duchess went into fits of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Arthur,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I shall never show
you a young lady&rsquo;s letter again!&nbsp; But what shall I say about
the clock?&nbsp; I think it is a capital invention, and I should like
to have one myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of them,&rsquo; said Lord Arthur,
with a sad smile, and, after kissing his mother, he left the room.</p>
<p>When he got upstairs, he flung himself on a sofa, and his eyes filled
with tears.&nbsp; He had done his best to commit this murder, but on
both occasions he had failed, and through no fault of his own.&nbsp;
He had tried to do his duty, but it seemed as if Destiny herself had
turned traitor.&nbsp; He was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness
of good intentions, of the futility of trying to be fine.&nbsp; Perhaps,
it would be better to break off the marriage altogether.&nbsp; Sybil
would suffer, it is true, but suffering could not really mar a nature
so noble as hers.&nbsp; As for himself, what did it matter?&nbsp; There
is always some war in which a man can die, some cause to which a man
can give his life, and as life had no pleasure for him, so death had
no terror.&nbsp; Let Destiny work out his doom.&nbsp; He would not stir
to help her.</p>
<p>At half-past seven he dressed, and went down to the club.&nbsp; Surbiton
was there with a party of young men, and he was obliged to dine with
them.&nbsp; Their trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest
him, and as soon as coffee was brought he left them, inventing some
engagement in order to get away.&nbsp; As he was going out of the club,
the hall-porter handed him a letter.&nbsp; It was from Herr Winckelkopf,
asking him to call down the next evening, and look at an explosive umbrella,
that went off as soon as it was opened.&nbsp; It was the very latest
invention, and had just arrived from Geneva.&nbsp; He tore the letter
up into fragments.&nbsp; He had made up his mind not to try any more
experiments.&nbsp; Then he wandered down to the Thames Embankment, and
sat for hours by the river.&nbsp; The moon peered through a mane of
tawny clouds, as if it were a lion&rsquo;s eye, and innumerable stars
spangled the hollow vault, like gold dust powdered on a purple dome.&nbsp;
Now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream, and floated away
with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green to scarlet
as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge.&nbsp; After some time,
twelve o&rsquo;clock boomed from the tall tower at Westminster, and
at each stroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble.&nbsp;
Then the railway lights went out, one solitary lamp left gleaming like
a large ruby on a giant mast, and the roar of the city became fainter.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock he got up, and strolled towards Blackfriars.&nbsp;
How unreal everything looked!&nbsp; How like a strange dream!&nbsp;
The houses on the other side of the river seemed built out of darkness.&nbsp;
One would have said that silver and shadow had fashioned the world anew.&nbsp;
The huge dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s loomed like a bubble through the dusky
air.</p>
<p>As he approached Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle he saw a man leaning over
the parapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the gas-light
falling full upon his face.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Podgers, the cheiromantist!&nbsp; No one could mistake
the fat, flabby face, the gold-rimmed spectacles, the sickly feeble
smile, the sensual mouth.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur stopped.&nbsp; A brilliant idea flashed across him, and
he stole softly up behind.&nbsp; In a moment he had seized Mr. Podgers
by the legs, and flung him into the Thames.&nbsp; There was a coarse
oath, a heavy splash, and all was still.&nbsp; Lord Arthur looked anxiously
over, but could see nothing of the cheiromantist but a tall hat, pirouetting
in an eddy of moonlit water.&nbsp; After a time it also sank, and no
trace of Mr. Podgers was visible.&nbsp; Once he thought that he caught
sight of the bulky misshapen figure striking out for the staircase by
the bridge, and a horrible feeling of failure came over him, but it
turned out to be merely a reflection, and when the moon shone out from
behind a cloud it passed away.&nbsp; At last he seemed to have realised
the decree of destiny.&nbsp; He heaved a deep sigh of relief, and Sybil&rsquo;s
name came to his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you dropped anything, sir?&rsquo; said a voice behind
him suddenly.</p>
<p>He turned round, and saw a policeman with a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing of importance, sergeant,&rsquo; he answered, smiling,
and hailing a passing hansom, he jumped in, and told the man to drive
to Belgrave Square.</p>
<p>For the next few days he alternated between hope and fear.&nbsp;
There were moments when he almost expected Mr. Podgers to walk into
the room, and yet at other times he felt that Fate could not be so unjust
to him.&nbsp; Twice he went to the cheiromantist&rsquo;s address in
West Moon Street, but he could not bring himself to ring the bell.&nbsp;
He longed for certainty, and was afraid of it.</p>
<p>Finally it came.&nbsp; He was sitting in the smoking-room of the
club having tea, and listening rather wearily to Surbiton&rsquo;s account
of the last comic song at the Gaiety, when the waiter came in with the
evening papers.&nbsp; He took up the <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>, and was
listlessly turning over its pages, when this strange heading caught
his eye:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>SUICIDE OF A CHEIROMANTIST.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He turned pale with excitement, and began to read.&nbsp; The paragraph
ran as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at seven o&rsquo;clock, the body of Mr. Septimus
R. Podgers, the eminent cheiromantist, was washed on shore at Greenwich,
just in front of the Ship Hotel.&nbsp; The unfortunate gentleman had
been missing for some days, and considerable anxiety for his safety
had been felt in cheiromantic circles.&nbsp; It is supposed that he
committed suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement,
caused by overwork, and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon
by the coroner&rsquo;s jury.&nbsp; Mr. Podgers had just completed an
elaborate treatise on the subject of the Human Hand, that will shortly
be published, when it will no doubt attract much attention.&nbsp; The
deceased was sixty-five years of age, and does not seem to have left
any relations.</p>
<p>Lord Arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand,
to the immense amazement of the hall-porter, who tried in vain to stop
him, and drove at once to Park Lane.&nbsp; Sybil saw him from the window,
and something told her that he was the bearer of good news.&nbsp; She
ran down to meet him, and, when she saw his face, she knew that all
was well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Sybil,&rsquo; cried Lord Arthur, &lsquo;let us be
married to-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You foolish boy!&nbsp; Why, the cake is not even ordered!&rsquo;
said Sybil, laughing through her tears.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter&rsquo;s
was crowded with a perfect mob of smart people.&nbsp; The service was
read in the most impressive manner by the Dean of Chichester, and everybody
agreed that they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and
bridegroom.&nbsp; They were more than handsome, however - they were
happy.&nbsp; Never for a single moment did Lord Arthur regret all that
he had suffered for Sybil&rsquo;s sake, while she, on her side, gave
him the best things a woman can give to any man - worship, tenderness,
and love.&nbsp; For them romance was not killed by reality.&nbsp; They
always felt young.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards, when two beautiful children had been born
to them, Lady Windermere came down on a visit to Alton Priory, a lovely
old place, that had been the Duke&rsquo;s wedding present to his son;
and one afternoon as she was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-tree
in the garden, watching the little boy and girl as they played up and
down the rose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took her hostess&rsquo;s
hand in hers, and said, &lsquo;Are you happy, Sybil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lady Windermere, of course I am happy.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no time to be happy, Sybil.&nbsp; I always like the
last person who is introduced to me; but, as a rule, as soon as I know
people I get tired of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t your lions satisfy you, Lady Windermere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, no! lions are only good for one season.&nbsp; As
soon as their manes are cut, they are the dullest creatures going.&nbsp;
Besides, they behave very badly, if you are really nice to them.&nbsp;
Do you remember that horrid Mr. Podgers?&nbsp; He was a dreadful impostor.&nbsp;
Of course, I didn&rsquo;t mind that at all, and even when he wanted
to borrow money I forgave him, but I could not stand his making love
to me.&nbsp; He has really made me hate cheiromancy.&nbsp; I go in for
telepathy now.&nbsp; It is much more amusing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say anything against cheiromancy here, Lady
Windermere; it is the only subject that Arthur does not like people
to chaff about.&nbsp; I assure you he is quite serious over it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that he believes in it, Sybil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask him, Lady Windermere, here he is&rsquo;; and Lord Arthur
came up the garden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and
his two children dancing round him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Arthur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Lady Windermere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; said the young man, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I owe to it all the happiness of my life,&rsquo; he
murmured, throwing himself into a wicker chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Lord Arthur, what do you owe to it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sybil,&rsquo; he answered, handing his wife the roses, and
looking into her violet eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense!&rsquo; cried Lady Windermere.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
never heard such nonsense in all my life.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE CANTERVILLE GHOST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville
Chase, every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there
was no doubt at all that the place was haunted.&nbsp; Indeed, Lord Canterville
himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his
duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,&rsquo; said
Lord Canterville, &lsquo;since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of
Bolton, was frightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered,
by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing
for dinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has
been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the
rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; After the unfortunate accident
to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and
Lady Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence
of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Lord,&rsquo; answered the Minister, &lsquo;I will take
the furniture and the ghost at a valuation.&nbsp; I come from a modern
country, where we have everything that money can buy; and with all our
spry young fellows painting the Old World red, and carrying off your
best actresses and prima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a
thing as a ghost in Europe, we&rsquo;d have it at home in a very short
time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear that the ghost exists,&rsquo; said Lord Canterville,
smiling, &lsquo;though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising
impresarios.&nbsp; It has been well known for three centuries, since
1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any
member of our family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville.&nbsp;
But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of
Nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are certainly very natural in America,&rsquo; answered
Lord Canterville, who did not quite understand Mr. Otis&rsquo;s last
observation, &lsquo;and if you don&rsquo;t mind a ghost in the house,
it is all right.&nbsp; Only you must remember I warned you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks after this, the purchase was completed, and at the close
of the season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.&nbsp;
Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53rd Street, had
been a celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged
woman, with fine eyes, and a superb profile.&nbsp; Many American ladies
on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health,
under the impression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs.
Otis had never fallen into this error.&nbsp; She had a magnificent constitution,
and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits.&nbsp; Indeed, in many
respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the
fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays,
except, of course, language.&nbsp; Her eldest son, christened Washington
by his parents in a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret,
was a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified
himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport
Casino for three successive seasons, and even in London was well known
as an excellent dancer.&nbsp; Gardenias and the peerage were his only
weaknesses.&nbsp; Otherwise he was extremely sensible.&nbsp; Miss Virginia
E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and
with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes.&nbsp; She was a wonderful
amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the
park, winning by a length and a half, just in front of the Achilles
statue, to the huge delight of the young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed
for her on the spot, and was sent back to Eton that very night by his
guardians, in floods of tears.&nbsp; After Virginia came the twins,
who were usually called &lsquo;The Stars and Stripes,&rsquo; as they
were always getting swished.&nbsp; They were delightful boys, and with
the exception of the worthy Minister the only true republicans of the
family.</p>
<p>As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway
station, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and
they started on their drive in high spirits.&nbsp; It was a lovely July
evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pine-woods.&nbsp;
Now and then they heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice,
or saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.&nbsp;
Little squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,
and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy
knolls, with their white tails in the air.&nbsp; As they entered the
avenue of Canterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast
with clouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great
flight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they reached
the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.</p>
<p>Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed
in black silk, with a white cap and apron.&nbsp; This was Mrs. Umney,
the housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville&rsquo;s earnest
request, had consented to keep on in her former position.&nbsp; She
made them each a low curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint,
old-fashioned manner, &lsquo;I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Following her, they passed through the fine Tudor hall into the library,
a long, low room, panelled in black oak, at the end of which was a large
stained-glass window.&nbsp; Here they found tea laid out for them, and,
after taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round,
while Mrs. Umney waited on them.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor
just by the fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified,
said to Mrs. Umney, &lsquo;I am afraid something has been spilt there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, madam,&rsquo; replied the old housekeeper in a low voice,
&lsquo;blood has been spilt on that spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How horrid,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Otis; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t at
all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room.&nbsp; It must be removed
at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,
&lsquo;It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered
on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.&nbsp;
Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very
mysterious circumstances.&nbsp; His body has never been discovered,
but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase.&nbsp; The blood-stain
has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all nonsense,&rsquo; cried Washington Otis; &lsquo;Pinkerton&rsquo;s
Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no
time,&rsquo; and before the terrified housekeeper could interfere he
had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a
small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic.&nbsp; In a few moments
no trace of the blood-stain could be seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew Pinkerton would do it,&rsquo; he exclaimed triumphantly,
as he looked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said
these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room,
a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.
Umney fainted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a monstrous climate!&rsquo; said the American Minister
calmly, as he lit a long cheroot.&nbsp; &lsquo;I guess the old country
is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody.&nbsp;
I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Hiram,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Otis, &lsquo;what can we
do with a woman who faints?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charge it to her like breakages,&rsquo; answered the Minister;
&lsquo;she won&rsquo;t faint after that&rsquo;; and in a few moments
Mrs. Umney certainly came to.&nbsp; There was no doubt, however, that
she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of
some trouble coming to the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;that would make any Christian&rsquo;s hair stand on end, and
many and many a night I have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful
things that are done here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Otis, however, and his wife
warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts,
and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on her new master and
mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of salary, the old
housekeeper tottered off to her own room.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular
note occurred.&nbsp; The next morning, however, when they came down
to breakfast, they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the
floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it can be the fault of the Paragon
Detergent,&rsquo; said Washington, &lsquo;for I have tried it with everything.&nbsp;
It must be the ghost.&rsquo;&nbsp; He accordingly rubbed out the stain
a second time, but the second morning it appeared again.&nbsp; The third
morning also it was there, though the library had been locked up at
night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried upstairs.&nbsp; The whole
family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he
had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts, Mrs.
Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical Society, and Washington
prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of
the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime.&nbsp;
That night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata were
removed for ever.</p>
<p>The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening,
the whole family went out for a drive.&nbsp; They did not return home
till nine o&rsquo;clock, when they had a light supper.&nbsp; The conversation
in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions
of receptive expectation which so often precede the presentation of
psychical phenomena.&nbsp; The subjects discussed, as I have since learned
from Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of
cultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority
of Miss Fanny Davenport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty
of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best
English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the world-soul;
the advantages of the baggage check system in railway travelling; and
the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl.&nbsp;
No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was Sir Simon de
Canterville alluded to in any way.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock the
family retired, and by half-past all the lights were out.&nbsp; Some
time after, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor,
outside his room.&nbsp; It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed
to be coming nearer every moment.&nbsp; He got up at once, struck a
match, and looked at the time.&nbsp; It was exactly one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish.&nbsp;
The strange noise still continued, and with it he heard distinctly the
sound of footsteps.&nbsp; He put on his slippers, took a small oblong
phial out of his dressing-case, and opened the door.&nbsp; Right in
front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect.&nbsp;
His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair fell over his shoulders
in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut, were soiled
and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty
gyves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Otis, &lsquo;I really must insist
on your oiling those chains, and have brought you for that purpose a
small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator.&nbsp; It is said
to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several
testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent
native divines.&nbsp; I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles,
and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
With these words the United States Minister laid the bottle down on
a marble table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.</p>
<p>For a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural
indignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,
he fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly
green light.&nbsp; Just, however, as he reached the top of the great
oak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures
appeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!&nbsp; There was
evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth Dimension
of Space as a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting,
and the house became quite quiet.</p>
<p>On reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up
against a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realise
his position.&nbsp; Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of
three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted.&nbsp; He thought
of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood
before the glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who
had gone off into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the
curtains of one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish,
whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the
library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since,
a perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac,
who, having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated
in an arm-chair by the fire reading her diary, had been confined to
her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery,
had become reconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with
that notorious sceptic Monsieur de Voltaire.&nbsp; He remembered the
terrible night when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in
his dressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat,
and confessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James
Fox out of &pound;50,000 at Crockford&rsquo;s by means of that very
card, and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it.&nbsp; All his
great achievements came back to him again, from the butler who had shot
himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the
window pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged
to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five
fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in
the carp-pond at the end of the King&rsquo;s Walk.&nbsp; With the enthusiastic
egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated performances,
and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance
as &lsquo;Red Ruben, or the Strangled Babe,&rsquo; his <i>d&eacute;but</i>
as &lsquo;Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,&rsquo; and
the <i>furore</i> he had excited one lovely June evening by merely playing
ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground.&nbsp; And after
all this, some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him
the Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head!&nbsp; It was
quite unbearable.&nbsp; Besides, no ghosts in history had ever been
treated in this manner.&nbsp; Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance,
and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The next morning when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed
the ghost at some length.&nbsp; The United States Minister was naturally
a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have no wish,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to do the ghost any personal
injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been
in the house, I don&rsquo;t think it is at all polite to throw pillows
at him&rsquo; - a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the
twins burst into shouts of laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon the other hand,&rsquo;
he continued, &lsquo;if he really declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator,
we shall have to take his chains from him.&nbsp; It would be quite impossible
to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only
thing that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the
blood-stain on the library floor.&nbsp; This certainly was very strange,
as the door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows
kept closely barred.&nbsp; The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain
excited a good deal of comment.&nbsp; Some mornings it was a dull (almost
Indian) red, then it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once
when they came down for family prayers, according to the simple rites
of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright
emerald-green.&nbsp; These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the
party very much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening.&nbsp;
The only person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia,
who, for some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed
at the sight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it
was emerald-green.</p>
<p>The second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night.&nbsp; Shortly
after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash
in the hall.&nbsp; Rushing downstairs, they found that a large suit
of old armour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on
the stone floor, while, seated in a high-backed chair, was the Canterville
ghost, rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face.&nbsp;
The twins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged
two pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained
by long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United States
Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance
with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands!&nbsp; The ghost started
up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing
Washington Otis&rsquo;s candle as he passed, and so leaving them all
in total darkness.&nbsp; On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered
himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter.&nbsp;
This he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful.&nbsp;
It was said to have turned Lord Raker&rsquo;s wig grey in a single night,
and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville&rsquo;s French governesses
give warning before their month was up.&nbsp; He accordingly laughed
his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again,
but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened, and Mrs.
Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid
you are far from well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and have brought you
a bottle of Dr. Dobell&rsquo;s tincture.&nbsp; If it is indigestion,
you will find it a most excellent remedy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ghost glared
at her in fury, and began at once to make preparations for turning himself
into a large black dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned,
and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy
of Lord Canterville&rsquo;s uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton.&nbsp; The
sound of approaching footsteps, however, made him hesitate in his fell
purpose, so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent,
and vanished with a deep churchyard groan, just as the twins had come
up to him.</p>
<p>On reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to
the most violent agitation.&nbsp; The vulgarity of the twins, and the
gross materialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but
what really distressed him most was, that he had been unable to wear
the suit of mail.&nbsp; He had hoped that even modern Americans would
be thrilled by the sight of a Spectre In Armour, if for no more sensible
reason, at least out of respect for their national poet Longfellow,
over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away
many a weary hour when the Cantervilles were up in town.&nbsp; Besides,
it was his own suit.&nbsp; He had worn it with great success at the
Kenilworth tournament, and had been highly complimented on it by no
less a person than the Virgin Queen herself.&nbsp; Yet when he had put
it on, he had been completely overpowered by the weight of the huge
breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen heavily on the stone pavement,
barking both his knees severely, and bruising the knuckles of his right
hand.</p>
<p>For some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred
out of his room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.&nbsp;
However, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved
to make a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his
family.&nbsp; He selected Friday, the 17th of August, for his appearance,
and spent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately
deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet
frilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger.&nbsp; Towards evening
a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the
windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.&nbsp; In fact,
it was just such weather as he loved.&nbsp; His plan of action was this.&nbsp;
He was to make his way quietly to Washington Otis&rsquo;s room, gibber
at him from the foot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the
throat to the sound of slow music.&nbsp; He bore Washington a special
grudge, being quite aware that it was he who was in the habit of removing
the famous Canterville blood-stain, by means of Pinkerton&rsquo;s Paragon
Detergent.&nbsp; Having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to
a condition of abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room occupied
by the United States Minister and his wife, and there to place a clammy
hand on Mrs. Otis&rsquo;s forehead, while he hissed into her trembling
husband&rsquo;s ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house.&nbsp; With
regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made up his mind.&nbsp;
She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and gentle.&nbsp;
A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more than
sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the
counterpane with palsy-twitching fingers.&nbsp; As for the twins, he
was quite determined to teach them a lesson.&nbsp; The first thing to
be done was, of course, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the
stifling sensation of nightmare.&nbsp; Then, as their beds were quite
close to each other, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold
corpse, till they became paralysed with fear, and finally, to throw
off the winding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white bleached
bones and one rolling eye-ball, in the character of &lsquo;Dumb Daniel,
or the Suicide&rsquo;s Skeleton,&rsquo; a <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in which
he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect, and which
he considered quite equal to his famous part of &lsquo;Martin the Maniac,
or the Masked Mystery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At half-past ten he heard the family going to bed.&nbsp; For some
time he was disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who,
with the light-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing
themselves before they retired to rest, but at a quarter past eleven
all was still, and, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth.&nbsp; The
owl beat against the window panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree,
and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but
the Otis family slept unconscious of their doom, and high above the
rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the Minister for
the United States.&nbsp; He stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting,
with an evil smile on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her
face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window, where his own
arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold.&nbsp;
On and on he glided, like an evil shadow, the very darkness seeming
to loathe him as he passed.&nbsp; Once he thought he heard something
call, and stopped; but it was only the baying of a dog from the Red
Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-century curses, and
ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air.&nbsp;
Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless Washington&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; For a moment he paused there, the wind blowing his long
grey locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic
folds the nameless horror of the dead man&rsquo;s shroud.&nbsp; Then
the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come.&nbsp; He
chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done
so, than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched
face in his long, bony hands.&nbsp; Right in front of him was standing
a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a
madman&rsquo;s dream!&nbsp; Its head was bald and burnished; its face
round, and fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed
its features into an eternal grin.&nbsp; From the eyes streamed rays
of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment,
like to his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.&nbsp;
On its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters,
some scroll of shame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful
calendar of crime, and, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion
of gleaming steel.</p>
<p>Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,
and, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back
to his room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the
corridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister&rsquo;s
jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.&nbsp; Once
in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small
pallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes.&nbsp; After a time,
however, the brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined
to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.&nbsp;
Accordingly, just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he
returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly
phantom, feeling that, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and
that, by the aid of his new friend, he might safely grapple with the
twins.&nbsp; On reaching the spot, however, a terrible sight met his
gaze.&nbsp; Something had evidently happened to the spectre, for the
light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion
had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning up against the wall in
a strained and uncomfortable attitude.&nbsp; He rushed forward and seized
it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped off and rolled
on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he found himself
clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen
cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!&nbsp; Unable to understand
this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste,
and there, in the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>YE OLDE GHOSTE</p>
<p>Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook.<br />Beware of Ye Imitationes.<br />All
others are Counterfeite.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The whole thing flashed across him.&nbsp; He had been tricked, foiled,
and outwitted!&nbsp; The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he
ground his toothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands
high above his head, swore, according to the picturesque phraseology
of the antique school, that when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry
horn, deeds of blood would be wrought, and Murder walk abroad with silent
feet.</p>
<p>Hardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof
of a distant homestead, a cock crew.&nbsp; He laughed a long, low, bitter
laugh, and waited.&nbsp; Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for
some strange reason, did not crow again.&nbsp; Finally, at half-past
seven, the arrival of the housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil,
and he stalked back to his room, thinking of his vain hope and baffled
purpose.&nbsp; There he consulted several books of ancient chivalry,
of which he was exceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion
on which his oath had been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perdition seize the naughty fowl,&rsquo; he muttered,
&lsquo;I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run
him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an &rsquo;twere in death!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and stayed there till
evening.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The next day the ghost was very weak and tired.&nbsp; The terrible
excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect.&nbsp;
His nerves were completely shattered, and he started at the slightest
noise.&nbsp; For five days he kept his room, and at last made up his
mind to give up the point of the blood-stain on the library floor.&nbsp;
If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve it.&nbsp;
They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence, and
quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena.&nbsp;
The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of astral
bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under
his control.&nbsp; It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor
once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first
and third Wednesday in every month, and he did not see how he could
honourably escape from his obligations.&nbsp; It is quite true that
his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was most conscientious
in all things connected with the supernatural.&nbsp; For the next three
Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight
and three o&rsquo;clock, taking every possible precaution against being
either heard or seen.&nbsp; He removed his boots, trod as lightly as
possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak,
and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains.&nbsp;
I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty
that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection.&nbsp;
However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into
Mr. Otis&rsquo;s bedroom and carried off the bottle.&nbsp; He felt a
little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see
that there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a
certain degree, it served his purpose.&nbsp; Still, in spite of everything,
he was not left unmolested.&nbsp; Strings were continually being stretched
across the corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,
while dressed for the part of &lsquo;Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of
Hogley Woods,&rsquo; he met with a severe fall, through treading on
a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance of
the Tapestry Chamber to the top of the oak staircase.&nbsp; This last
insult so enraged him, that he resolved to make one final effort to
assert his dignity and social position, and determined to visit the
insolent young Etonians the next night in his celebrated character of
&lsquo;Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years;
in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by
means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present
Lord Canterville&rsquo;s grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with
handsome Jack Castleton, declaring that nothing in the world would induce
her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk
up and down the terrace at twilight.&nbsp; Poor Jack was afterwards
shot in a duel by Lord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara
died of a broken heart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so,
in every way, it had been a great success.&nbsp; It was, however, an
extremely difficult &lsquo;make-up,&rsquo; if I may use such a theatrical
expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural,
or, to employ a more scientific term, the higher-natural world, and
it took him fully three hours to make his preparations.&nbsp; At last
everything was ready, and he was very pleased with his appearance.&nbsp;
The big leather riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little
too large for him, and he could only find one of the two horse-pistols,
but, on the whole, he was quite satisfied, and at a quarter past one
he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor.&nbsp;
On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which I should mention was
called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the colour of its hangings,
he found the door just ajar.&nbsp; Wishing to make an effective entrance,
he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on
him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by
a couple of inches.&nbsp; At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks
of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed.&nbsp; The shock to his
nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as
he could go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold.&nbsp;
The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the
fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so,
the consequences might have been very serious.</p>
<p>He now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,
and contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in
list slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of
draughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the
twins.&nbsp; The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September.&nbsp;
He had gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that
there, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself
by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United
States Minister and his wife, which had now taken the place of the Canterville
family pictures.&nbsp; He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud,
spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow
linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton&rsquo;s spade.&nbsp;
In fact, he was dressed for the character of &lsquo;Jonas the Graveless,
or the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,&rsquo; one of his most remarkable
impersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to remember,
as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord
Rufford.&nbsp; It was about a quarter past two o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring.&nbsp;
As he was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were
any traces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him
from a dark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their
heads, and shrieked out &lsquo;BOO!&rsquo; in his ear.</p>
<p>Seized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,
he rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him
there with the big garden-syringe; and being thus hemmed in by his enemies
on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great
iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make
his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room
in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.</p>
<p>After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition.&nbsp;
The twins lay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the
passages with nutshells every night to the great annoyance of their
parents and the servants, but it was of no avail.&nbsp; It was quite
evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear.&nbsp;
Mr. Otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the Democratic
Party, on which he had been engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organised
a wonderful clam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took
to lacrosse, euchre, poker, and other American national games; and Virginia
rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,
who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase.&nbsp;
It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact,
Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in
reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best congratulations
to the Minister&rsquo;s worthy wife.</p>
<p>The Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the
house, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let
matters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the
young Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had
once bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice
with the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on
the floor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state, that
though he lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything
again but &lsquo;Double Sixes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The story was well known
at the time, though, of course, out of respect to the feelings of the
two noble families, every attempt was made to hush it up; and a full
account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in
the third volume of Lord Tattle&rsquo;s <i>Recollections of the Prince
Regent</i> <i>and his Friends</i>.&nbsp; The ghost, then, was naturally
very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons,
with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin
having been married <i>en secondes noces</i> to the Sieur de Bulkeley,
from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended.&nbsp;
Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia&rsquo;s
little lover in his celebrated impersonation of &lsquo;The Vampire Monk,
or, the Bloodless Benedictine,&rsquo; a performance so horrible that
when old Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year&rsquo;s
Eve, in the year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks,
which culminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after
disinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and
leaving all her money to her London apothecary.&nbsp; At the last moment,
however, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and
the little Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the
Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went
out riding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in
getting through a hedge, that, on her return home, she made up her mind
to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen.&nbsp; As she was
running past the Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be
open, she fancied she saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother&rsquo;s
maid, who sometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her
to mend her habit.&nbsp; To her immense surprise, however, it was the
Canterville Ghost himself!&nbsp; He was sitting by the window, watching
the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air, and the
red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue.&nbsp; His head was leaning
on his hand, and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression.&nbsp;
Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look, that little
Virginia, whose first idea had been to run away and lock herself in
her room, was filled with pity, and determined to try and comfort him.&nbsp;
So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that he was not
aware of her presence till she spoke to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry for you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but my brothers
are going back to Eton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself,
no one will annoy you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is absurd asking me to behave myself,&rsquo; he answered,
looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured
to address him, &lsquo;quite absurd.&nbsp; I must rattle my chains,
and groan through keyholes, and walk about at night, if that is what
you mean.&nbsp; It is my only reason for existing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have
been very wicked.&nbsp; Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived
here, that you had killed your wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I quite admit it,&rsquo; said the Ghost petulantly,
&lsquo;but it was a purely family matter, and concerned no one else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very wrong to kill any one,&rsquo; said Virginia, who
at times had a sweet Puritan gravity, caught from some old New England
ancestor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!&nbsp; My
wife was very plain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew
nothing about cookery.&nbsp; Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley
Woods, a magnificent pricket, and do you know how she had it sent up
to table?&nbsp; However, it is no matter now, for it is all over, and
I don&rsquo;t think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to
death, though I did kill her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Starve you to death?&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Ghost, I mean Sir Simon,
are you hungry?&nbsp; I have a sandwich in my case.&nbsp; Would you
like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind
of you, all the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid,
rude, vulgar, dishonest family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried Virginia, stamping her foot, &lsquo;it
is you who are rude, and horrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty,
you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that
ridiculous blood-stain in the library.&nbsp; First you took all my reds,
including the vermilion, and I couldn&rsquo;t do any more sunsets, then
you took the emerald-green and the chrome-yellow, and finally I had
nothing left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only do moonlight
scenes, which are always depressing to look at, and not at all easy
to paint.&nbsp; I never told on you, though I was very much annoyed,
and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who ever heard of emerald-green
blood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, really,&rsquo; said the Ghost, rather meekly, &lsquo;what
was I to do?&nbsp; It is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays,
and, as your brother began it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly
saw no reason why I should not have your paints.&nbsp; As for colour,
that is always a matter of taste: the Cantervilles have blue blood,
for instance, the very bluest in England; but I know you Americans don&rsquo;t
care for things of this kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is
to emigrate and improve your mind.&nbsp; My father will be only too
happy to give you a free passage, and though there is a heavy duty on
spirits of every kind, there will be no difficulty about the Custom
House, as the officers are all Democrats.&nbsp; Once in New York, you
are sure to be a great success.&nbsp; I know lots of people there who
would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather, and much
more than that to have a family Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,&rsquo;
said Virginia satirically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No ruins! no curiosities!&rsquo; answered the Ghost; &lsquo;you
have your navy and your manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra
week&rsquo;s holiday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t go, Miss Virginia,&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;I
am so lonely and so unhappy, and I really don&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp;
I want to go to sleep and I cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s quite absurd!&nbsp; You have merely to go to
bed and blow out the candle.&nbsp; It is very difficult sometimes to
keep awake, especially at church, but there is no difficulty at all
about sleeping.&nbsp; Why, even babies know how to do that, and they
are not very clever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not slept for three hundred years,&rsquo; he said sadly,
and Virginia&rsquo;s beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; &lsquo;for
three hundred years I have not slept, and I am so tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Virginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves.&nbsp;
She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into
his old withered face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor, poor Ghost,&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;have you no
place where you can sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Far away beyond the pine-woods,&rsquo; he answered, in a low
dreamy voice, &lsquo;there is a little garden.&nbsp; There the grass
grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock
flower, there the nightingale sings all night long.&nbsp; All night
long he sings, and the cold, crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree
spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in
her hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean the Garden of Death,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Death.&nbsp; Death must be so beautiful.&nbsp; To lie
in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one&rsquo;s head,
and listen to silence.&nbsp; To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.&nbsp;
To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.&nbsp; You can help
me.&nbsp; You can open for me the portals of Death&rsquo;s house, for
Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than Death is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Virginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few
moments there was silence.&nbsp; She felt as if she was in a terrible
dream.</p>
<p>Then the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing
of the wind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, often,&rsquo; cried the little girl, looking up; &lsquo;I
know it quite well.&nbsp; It is painted in curious black letters, and
it is difficult to read.&nbsp; There are only six lines:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When a golden girl can win<br />Prayer from out the lips of sin,<br />When
the barren almond bears,<br />And a little child gives away its tears,<br />Then
shall all the house be still<br />And peace come to Canterville.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what they mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They mean,&rsquo; he said sadly, &lsquo;that you must weep
for me for my sins, because I have no tears, and pray with me for my
soul, because I have no faith, and then, if you have always been sweet,
and good, and gentle, the Angel of Death will have mercy on me.&nbsp;
You will see fearful shapes in darkness, and wicked voices will whisper
in your ear, but they will not harm you, for against the purity of a
little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Virginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair
as he looked down at her bowed golden head.&nbsp; Suddenly she stood
up, very pale, and with a strange light in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am not afraid,&rsquo; she said firmly, &lsquo;and I will ask the Angel
to have mercy on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand
bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.&nbsp; His fingers
were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did
not falter, as he led her across the dusky room.&nbsp; On the faded
green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen.&nbsp; They blew their
tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Go back! little Virginia,&rsquo; they cried, &lsquo;go back!&rsquo;
but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and she shut her eyes
against them.&nbsp; Horrible animals with lizard tails, and goggle eyes,
blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured &lsquo;Beware!
little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,&rsquo; but the
Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.&nbsp; When
they reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words
she could not understand.&nbsp; She opened her eyes, and saw the wall
slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of
her.&nbsp; A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something
pulling at her dress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Quick, quick,&rsquo; cried the Ghost,
&lsquo;or it will be too late,&rsquo; and, in a moment, the wainscoting
had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia
did not come down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her.&nbsp;
After a little time he returned and said that he could not find Miss
Virginia anywhere.&nbsp; As she was in the habit of going out to the
garden every evening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis
was not at all alarmed at first, but when six o&rsquo;clock struck,
and Virginia did not appear, she became really agitated, and sent the
boys out to look for her, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every
room in the house.&nbsp; At half-past six the boys came back and said
that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere.&nbsp; They were
all now in the greatest state of excitement, and did not know what to
do, when Mr. Otis suddenly remembered that, some few days before, he
had given a band of gypsies permission to camp in the park.&nbsp; He
accordingly at once set off for Blackfell Hollow, where he knew they
were, accompanied by his eldest son and two of the farm-servants.&nbsp;
The little Duke of Cheshire, who was perfectly frantic with anxiety,
begged hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would not allow him,
as he was afraid there might be a scuffle.&nbsp; On arriving at the
spot, however, he found that the gypsies had gone, and it was evident
that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire was still burning,
and some plates were lying on the grass.&nbsp; Having sent off Washington
and the two men to scour the district, he ran home, and despatched telegrams
to all the police inspectors in the county, telling them to look out
for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gypsies.&nbsp;
He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after insisting
on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down
the Ascot Road with a groom.&nbsp; He had hardly, however, gone a couple
of miles when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round,
saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed
and no hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,&rsquo; gasped
out the boy, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t eat any dinner as long as Virginia
is lost.&nbsp; Please, don&rsquo;t be angry with me; if you had let
us be engaged last year, there would never have been all this trouble.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t send me back, will you?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t go!&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,
and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning
down from his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said,
&lsquo;Well, Cecil, if you won&rsquo;t go back I suppose you must come
with me, but I must get you a hat at Ascot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bother my hat!&nbsp; I want Virginia!&rsquo; cried the
little Duke, laughing, and they galloped on to the railway station.&nbsp;
There Mr. Otis inquired of the station-master if any one answering the
description of Virginia had been seen on the platform, but could get
no news of her.&nbsp; The station-master, however, wired up and down
the line, and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her,
and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen-draper,
who was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a
village about four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt
of the gypsies, as there was a large common next to it.&nbsp; Here they
roused up the rural policeman, but could get no information from him,
and, after riding all over the common, they turned their horses&rsquo;
heads homewards, and reached the Chase about eleven o&rsquo;clock, dead-tired
and almost heart-broken.&nbsp; They found Washington and the twins waiting
for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue was very dark.&nbsp;
Not the slightest trace of Virginia had been discovered.&nbsp; The gypsies
had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them, and
they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken
the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they
might be late.&nbsp; Indeed, they had been quite distressed at hearing
of Virginia&rsquo;s disappearance, as they were very grateful to Mr.
Otis for having allowed them to camp in his park, and four of their
number had stayed behind to help in the search.&nbsp; The carp-pond
had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone over, but without
any result.&nbsp; It was evident that, for that night at any rate, Virginia
was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest depression that
Mr Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom following behind
with the two horses and the pony.&nbsp; In the hall they found a group
of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library was poor
Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and having
her forehead bathed with eau-de-cologne by the old housekeeper.&nbsp;
Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered
up supper for the whole party.&nbsp; It was a melancholy meal, as hardly
any one spoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they
were very fond of their sister.&nbsp; When they had finished, Mr. Otis,
in spite of the entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed,
saying that nothing more could be done that night, and that he would
telegraph in the morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be
sent down immediately.&nbsp; Just as they were passing out of the dining-room,
midnight began to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke
sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal
of thunder shook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through
the air, a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise,
and out on the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket
in her hand, stepped Virginia.&nbsp; In a moment they had all rushed
up to her.&nbsp; Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her arms, the
Duke smothered her with violent kisses, and the twins executed a wild
war-dance round the group.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens! child, where have you been?&rsquo; said Mr.
Otis, rather angrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish
trick on them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cecil and I have been riding all over the
country looking for you, and your mother has been frightened to death.&nbsp;
You must never play these practical jokes any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!&rsquo; shrieked
the twins, as they capered about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave
my side again,&rsquo; murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling
child, and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; said Virginia quietly, &lsquo;I have been with
the Ghost.&nbsp; He is dead, and you must come and see him.&nbsp; He
had been very wicked, but he was really sorry for all that he had done,
and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite
grave and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening
in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following
with a lighted candle, which he had caught up from the table.&nbsp;
Finally, they came to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails.&nbsp;
When Virginia touched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they
found themselves in a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one
tiny grated window.&nbsp; Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring,
and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full
length on the stone floor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its
long fleshless fingers an old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were
placed just out of its reach.&nbsp; The jug had evidently been once
filled with water, as it was covered inside with green mould.&nbsp;
There was nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust.&nbsp; Virginia
knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little hands together,
began to pray silently, while the rest of the party looked on in wonder
at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had
been looking out of the window to try and discover in what wing of the
house the room was situated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hallo! the old withered almond-tree
has blossomed.&nbsp; I can see the flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God has forgiven him,&rsquo; said Virginia gravely, as she
rose to her feet, and a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an angel you are!&rsquo; cried the young Duke, and he
put his arm round her neck and kissed her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from Canterville
Chase at about eleven o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; The hearse was drawn
by eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft
of nodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich
purple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms.&nbsp;
By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted
torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive.&nbsp;
Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up specially from
Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage along with
little Virginia.&nbsp; Then came the United States Minister and his
wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was
Mrs. Umney.&nbsp; It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened
by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right
to see the last of him.&nbsp; A deep grave had been dug in the corner
of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service was
read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.&nbsp;
When the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom
observed in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and,
as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward
and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms.&nbsp;
As she did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with
its silent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a
nightingale began to sing.&nbsp; She thought of the ghost&rsquo;s description
of the Garden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly
spoke a word during the drive home.</p>
<p>The next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis
had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had
given to Virginia.&nbsp; They were perfectly magnificent, especially
a certain ruby necklace with old Venetian setting, which was really
a superb specimen of sixteenth-century work, and their value was so
great that Mr. Otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter
to accept them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know that in this country
mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is
quite clear to me that these jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in
your family.&nbsp; I must beg you, accordingly, to take them to London
with you, and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which
has been restored to you under certain strange conditions.&nbsp; As
for my daughter, she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to
say, but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury.&nbsp;
I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I may say, is no mean authority
upon Art - having had the privilege of spending several winters in Boston
when she was a girl - that these gems are of great monetary worth, and
if offered for sale would fetch a tall price.&nbsp; Under these circumstances,
Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will recognise how impossible
it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any
member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds and toys, however
suitable or necessary to the dignity of the British aristocracy, would
be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the
severe, and I believe immortal, principles of republican simplicity.&nbsp;
Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very anxious that you should
allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided
ancestor.&nbsp; As it is extremely old, and consequently a good deal
out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request.&nbsp;
For my own part, I confess I am a good deal surprised to find a child
of mine expressing sympathy with mediaevalism in any form, and can only
account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in one of your London
suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to Athens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister&rsquo;s
speech, pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary
smile, and when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand,
and said, &lsquo;My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered
my unlucky ancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and
my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck.&nbsp;
The jewels are clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless
enough to take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of
his grave in a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life.&nbsp; As for
their being heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned
in a will or legal document, and the existence of these jewels has been
quite unknown.&nbsp; I assure you I have no more claim on them than
your butler, and when Miss Virginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased
to have pretty things to wear.&nbsp; Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis,
that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything
that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession, as,
whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night,
in point of law he was really dead, and you acquired his property by
purchase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville&rsquo;s refusal,
and begged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer
was quite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter
to retain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring
of 1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen&rsquo;s
first drawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were
the universal theme of admiration.&nbsp; For Virginia received the coronet,
which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married
to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age.&nbsp; They were both so
charming, and they loved each other so much, that every one was delighted
at the match, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried
to catch the Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had
given no less than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose,
and, strange to say, Mr. Otis himself.&nbsp; Mr. Otis was extremely
fond of the young Duke personally, but, theoretically, he objected to
titles, and, to use his own words, &lsquo;was not without apprehension
lest, amid the enervating influences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy,
the true principles of republican simplicity should be forgotten.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His objections, however, were completely overruled, and I believe that
when he walked up the aisle of St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, with
his daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a prouder man in the
whole length and breadth of England.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to
Canterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over
in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods.&nbsp; There
had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on
Sir Simon&rsquo;s tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave
on it simply the initials of the old gentleman&rsquo;s name, and the
verse from the library window.&nbsp; The Duchess had brought with her
some lovely roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and after they
had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel
of the old abbey.&nbsp; There the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar,
while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up
at her beautiful eyes.&nbsp; Suddenly he threw his cigarette away, took
hold of her hand, and said to her, &lsquo;Virginia, a wife should have
no secrets from her husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Cecil!&nbsp; I have no secrets from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you have,&rsquo; he answered, smiling, &lsquo;you have
never told me what happened to you when you were locked up with the
ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never told any one, Cecil,&rsquo; said Virginia gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that, but you might tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you.&nbsp;
Poor Sir Simon!&nbsp; I owe him a great deal.&nbsp; Yes, don&rsquo;t
laugh, Cecil, I really do.&nbsp; He made me see what Life is, and what
Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,&rsquo;
he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have always had that, Cecil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will tell our children some day, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Virginia blushed.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE SPHINX WITHOUT A SECRET</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>One afternoon I was sitting outside the Caf&eacute; de la Paix, watching
the splendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my
vermouth at the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing
before me, when I heard some one call my name.&nbsp; I turned round,
and saw Lord Murchison.&nbsp; We had not met since we had been at college
together, nearly ten years before, so I was delighted to come across
him again, and we shook hands warmly.&nbsp; At Oxford we had been great
friends.&nbsp; I had liked him immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited,
and so honourable.&nbsp; We used to say of him that he would be the
best of fellows, if he did not always speak the truth, but I think we
really admired him all the more for his frankness.&nbsp; I found him
a good deal changed.&nbsp; He looked anxious and puzzled, and seemed
to be in doubt about something.&nbsp; I felt it could not be modern
scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and believed in
the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I
concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was married yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand women well enough,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Gerald,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;women are meant to be
loved, not to be understood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot love where I cannot trust,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,&rsquo;
I exclaimed; &lsquo;tell me about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us go for a drive,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;it is too
crowded here.&nbsp; No, not a yellow carriage, any other colour - there,
that dark green one will do&rsquo;; and in a few moments we were trotting
down the boulevard in the direction of the Madeleine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall we go to?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, anywhere you like!&rsquo; he answered - &lsquo;to the
restaurant in the Bois; we will dine there, and you shall tell me all
about yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to hear about you first,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
me your mystery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took from his pocket a little silver-clasped morocco case, and
handed it to me.&nbsp; I opened it.&nbsp; Inside there was the photograph
of a woman.&nbsp; She was tall and slight, and strangely picturesque
with her large vague eyes and loosened hair.&nbsp; She looked like a
<i>clairvoyante</i>, and was wrapped in rich furs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of that face?&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;is
it truthful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I examined it carefully.&nbsp; It seemed to me the face of some one
who had a secret, but whether that secret was good or evil I could not
say.&nbsp; Its beauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteries - the
beauty, in fact, which is psychological, not plastic - and the faint
smile that just played across the lips was far too subtle to be really
sweet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he cried impatiently, &lsquo;what do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is the Gioconda in sables,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
me know all about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;after dinner,&rsquo; and began
to talk of other things.</p>
<p>When the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes I reminded Gerald
of his promise.&nbsp; He rose from his seat, walked two or three times
up and down the room, and, sinking into an armchair, told me the following
story:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;One evening,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I was walking down Bond
Street about five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was a terrific crush of
carriages, and the traffic was almost stopped.&nbsp; Close to the pavement
was standing a little yellow brougham, which, for some reason or other,
attracted my attention.&nbsp; As I passed by there looked out from it
the face I showed you this afternoon.&nbsp; It fascinated me immediately.&nbsp;
All that night I kept thinking of it, and all the next day.&nbsp; I
wandered up and down that wretched Row, peering into every carriage,
and waiting for the yellow brougham; but I could not find <i>ma belle
inconnue</i>, and at last I began to think she was merely a dream.&nbsp;
About a week afterwards I was dining with Madame de Rastail.&nbsp; Dinner
was for eight o&rsquo;clock; but at half-past eight we were still waiting
in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Finally the servant threw open the door,
and announced Lady Alroy.&nbsp; It was the woman I had been looking
for.&nbsp; She came in very slowly, looking like a moonbeam in grey
lace, and, to my intense delight, I was asked to take her in to dinner.&nbsp;
After we had sat down, I remarked quite innocently, &ldquo;I think I
caught sight of you in Bond Street some time ago, Lady Alroy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She grew very pale, and said to me in a low voice, &ldquo;Pray do not
talk so loud; you may be overheard.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt miserable at
having made such a bad beginning, and plunged recklessly into the subject
of the French plays.&nbsp; She spoke very little, always in the same
low musical voice, and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening.&nbsp;
I fell passionately, stupidly in love, and the indefinable atmosphere
of mystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity.&nbsp;
When she was going away, which she did very soon after dinner, I asked
her if I might call and see her.&nbsp; She hesitated for a moment, glanced
round to see if any one was near us, and then said, &ldquo;Yes; to-morrow
at a quarter to five.&rdquo;&nbsp; I begged Madame de Rastail to tell
me about her; but all that I could learn was that she was a widow with
a beautiful house in Park Lane, and as some scientific bore began a
dissertation on widows, as exemplifying the survival of the matrimonially
fittest, I left and went home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day I arrived at Park Lane punctual to the moment,
but was told by the butler that Lady Alroy had just gone out.&nbsp;
I went down to the club quite unhappy and very much puzzled, and after
long consideration wrote her a letter, asking if I might be allowed
to try my chance some other afternoon.&nbsp; I had no answer for several
days, but at last I got a little note saying she would be at home on
Sunday at four and with this extraordinary postscript: &ldquo;Please
do not write to me here again; I will explain when I see you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On Sunday she received me, and was perfectly charming; but when I was
going away she begged of me, if I ever had occasion to write to her
again, to address my letter to &ldquo;Mrs. Knox, care of Whittaker&rsquo;s
Library, Green Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are reasons,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;why I cannot receive letters in my own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All through the season I saw a great deal of her, and the
atmosphere of mystery never left her.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought that
she was in the power of some man, but she looked so unapproachable,
that I could not believe it.&nbsp; It was really very difficult for
me to come to any conclusion, for she was like one of those strange
crystals that one sees in museums, which are at one moment clear, and
at another clouded.&nbsp; At last I determined to ask her to be my wife:
I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that she imposed on all
my visits, and on the few letters I sent her.&nbsp; I wrote to her at
the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday at six.&nbsp;
She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight.&nbsp;
I was infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then -
in consequence of it, I see now.&nbsp; No; it was the woman herself
I loved.&nbsp; The mystery troubled me, maddened me.&nbsp; Why did chance
put me in its track?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You discovered it, then?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear so,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can judge
for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Monday came round I went to lunch with my uncle, and
about four o&rsquo;clock found myself in the Marylebone Road.&nbsp;
My uncle, you know, lives in Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; I wanted to
get to Piccadilly, and took a short cut through a lot of shabby little
streets.&nbsp; Suddenly I saw in front of me Lady Alroy, deeply veiled
and walking very fast.&nbsp; On coming to the last house in the street,
she went up the steps, took out a latch-key, and let herself in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is the mystery,&rdquo; I said to myself; and I hurried on
and examined the house.&nbsp; It seemed a sort of place for letting
lodgings.&nbsp; On the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had
dropped.&nbsp; I picked it up and put it in my pocket.&nbsp; Then I
began to consider what I should do.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion that
I had no right to spy on her, and I drove down to the club.&nbsp; At
six I called to see her.&nbsp; She was lying on a sofa, in a tea-gown
of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that she always
wore.&nbsp; She was looking quite lovely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am so glad
to see you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have not been out all day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I stared at her in amazement, and pulling the handkerchief out of my
pocket, handed it to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You dropped this in Cumnor Street
this afternoon, Lady Alroy,&rdquo;&nbsp; I said very calmly.&nbsp; She
looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take the handkerchief.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What were you doing there?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
right have you to question me?&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
right of a man who loves you,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I came here to
ask you to be my wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; She hid her face in her hands, and
burst into floods of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must tell me,&rdquo; I
continued.&nbsp; She stood up, and, looking me straight in the face,
said, &ldquo;Lord Murchison, there is nothing to tell you.&rdquo; -
&ldquo;You went to meet some one,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;this is your
mystery.&rdquo;&nbsp; She grew dreadfully white, and said, &ldquo;I
went to meet no one.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell the truth?&rdquo;
I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have told it,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
I was mad, frantic; I don&rsquo;t know what I said, but I said terrible
things to her.&nbsp; Finally I rushed out of the house.&nbsp; She wrote
me a letter the next day; I sent it back unopened, and started for Norway
with Alan Colville.&nbsp; After a month I came back, and the first thing
I saw in the <i>Morning Post</i> was the death of Lady Alroy.&nbsp;
She had caught a chill at the Opera, and had died in five days of congestion
of the lungs.&nbsp; I shut myself up and saw no one.&nbsp; I had loved
her so much, I had loved her so madly.&nbsp; Good God! how I had loved
that woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You went to the street, to the house in it?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day I went to Cumnor Street.&nbsp; I could not help it;
I was tortured with doubt.&nbsp; I knocked at the door, and a respectable-looking
woman opened it to me.&nbsp; I asked her if she had any rooms to let.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the drawing-rooms are supposed
to be let; but I have not seen the lady for three months, and as rent
is owing on them, you can have them.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Is this the lady?&rdquo;
I said, showing the photograph.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her, sure
enough,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;and when is she coming back, sir?&rdquo;
- &ldquo;The lady is dead,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh sir, I
hope not!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;she was my best lodger.&nbsp;
She paid me three guineas a week merely to sit in my drawing-rooms now
and then.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She met some one here?&rdquo; I said;
but the woman assured me that it was not so, that she always came alone,
and saw no one.&nbsp; &ldquo;What on earth did she do here?&rdquo; I
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;She simply sat in the drawing-room, sir, reading
books, and sometimes had tea,&rdquo; the woman answered.&nbsp; I did
not know what to say, so I gave her a sovereign and went away.&nbsp;
Now, what do you think it all meant?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t believe the
woman was telling the truth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did Lady Alroy go there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Gerald,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;Lady Alroy was simply
a woman with a mania for mystery.&nbsp; She took these rooms for the
pleasure of going there with her veil down, and imagining she was a
heroine.&nbsp; She had a passion for secrecy, but she herself was merely
a Sphinx without a secret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure of it,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>He took out the morocco case, opened it, and looked at the photograph.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wonder?&rsquo; he said at last.</p>

<h2>THE MODEL MILLIONAIRE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow.&nbsp;
Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed.&nbsp;
The poor should be practical and prosaic.&nbsp; It is better to have
a permanent income than to be fascinating.&nbsp; These are the great
truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised.&nbsp; Poor
Hughie!&nbsp; Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance.&nbsp;
He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life.&nbsp;
But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair,
his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes.&nbsp; He was as popular with
men as he was with women and he had every accomplishment except that
of making money.&nbsp; His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword
and a <i>History of the Peninsular War</i> in fifteen volumes.&nbsp;
Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf
between <i>Ruff&rsquo;s Guide</i> and <i>Bailey&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him.&nbsp;
He had tried everything.&nbsp; He had gone on the Stock Exchange for
six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears?&nbsp;
He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of
pekoe and souchong.&nbsp; Then he had tried selling dry sherry.&nbsp;
That did not answer; the sherry was a little too dry.&nbsp; Ultimately
he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect
profile and no profession.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, he was in love.&nbsp; The girl he loved was
Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper
and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again.&nbsp;
Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings.&nbsp; They
were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between
them.&nbsp; The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear
of any engagement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds
of your own, and we will see about it,&rsquo; he used to say; and Hughie
looked very glum in those days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.</p>
<p>One morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons
lived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor.&nbsp;
Trevor was a painter.&nbsp; Indeed, few people escape that nowadays.&nbsp;
But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare.&nbsp; Personally
he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged
beard.&nbsp; However, when he took up the brush he was a real master,
and his pictures were eagerly sought after.&nbsp; He had been very much
attracted by Hughie at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account
of his personal charm.&nbsp; &lsquo;The only people a painter should
know,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;are people who are <i>b&ecirc;te</i>
and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an
intellectual repose to talk to.&nbsp; Men who are dandies and women
who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so.&rsquo;&nbsp;
However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much
for his bright, buoyant spirits and his generous, reckless nature, and
had given him the permanent <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to his studio.</p>
<p>When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches
to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man.&nbsp; The beggar himself
was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio.&nbsp; He
was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most
piteous expression.&nbsp; Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown
cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled,
and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he
held out his battered hat for alms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an amazing model!&rsquo; whispered Hughie, as he shook
hands with his friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An amazing model?&rsquo; shouted Trevor at the top of his
voice; &lsquo;I should think so!&nbsp; Such beggars as he are not to
be met with every day.&nbsp; A <i>trouvaille, mon cher</i>; a living
Velasquez!&nbsp; My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made
of him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old chap!&rsquo; said Hughie, &lsquo;how miserable he
looks!&nbsp; But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Trevor, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t want
a beggar to look happy, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much does a model get for sitting?&rsquo; asked Hughie,
as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shilling an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, for this I get two thousand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guineas.&nbsp; Painters, poets, and physicians always get
guineas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I think the model should have a percentage,&rsquo; cried
Hughie, laughing; &lsquo;they work quite as hard as you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&nbsp; Why, look at the trouble of laying
on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one&rsquo;s easel!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you
that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual
labour.&nbsp; But you mustn&rsquo;t chatter; I&rsquo;m very busy.&nbsp;
Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the framemaker
wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t run away, Hughie,&rsquo; he said, as he went out,
&lsquo;I will be back in a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor&rsquo;s absence to rest
for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him.&nbsp; He looked
so forlorn and wretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and
felt in his pockets to see what money he had.&nbsp; All he could find
was a sovereign and some coppers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor old fellow,&rsquo;
he thought to himself, &lsquo;he wants it more than I do, but it means
no hansoms for a fortnight&rsquo;; and he walked across the studio and
slipped the sovereign into the beggar&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered
lips.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little
at what he had done.&nbsp; He spent the day with Laura, got a charming
scolding for his extravagance, and had to walk home.</p>
<p>That night he strolled into the Palette Club about eleven o&rsquo;clock,
and found Trevor sitting by himself in the smoking-room drinking hock
and seltzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Alan, did you get the picture finished all right?&rsquo;
he said, as he lit his cigarette.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finished and framed, my boy!&rsquo; answered Trevor; &lsquo;and,
by the bye, you have made a conquest.&nbsp; That old model you saw is
quite devoted to you.&nbsp; I had to tell him all about you - who you
are, where you live, what your income is, what prospects you have -
&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Alan,&rsquo; cried Hughie, &lsquo;I shall probably
find him waiting for me when I go home.&nbsp; But of course you are
only joking.&nbsp; Poor old wretch!&nbsp; I wish I could do something
for him.&nbsp; I think it is dreadful that any one should be so miserable.&nbsp;
I have got heaps of old clothes at home - do you think he would care
for any of them?&nbsp; Why, his rags were falling to bits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he looks splendid in them,&rsquo; said Trevor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t paint him in a frock coat for anything.&nbsp; What you
call rags I call romance.&nbsp; What seems poverty to you is picturesqueness
to me.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;ll tell him of your offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alan,&rsquo; said Hughie seriously, &lsquo;you painters are
a heartless lot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An artist&rsquo;s heart is his head,&rsquo; replied Trevor;
&lsquo;and besides, our business is to realise the world as we see it,
not to reform it as we know it.&nbsp; <i>&Agrave; chacun son m&eacute;tier</i>.&nbsp;
And now tell me how Laura is.&nbsp; The old model was quite interested
in her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you talked to him about her?&rsquo;
said Hughie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I did.&nbsp; He knows all about the relentless colonel,
the lovely Laura, and the &pound;10,000.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told that old beggar all my private affairs?&rsquo; cried
Hughie, looking very red and angry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear boy,&rsquo; said Trevor, smiling, &lsquo;that old
beggar, as you call him, is one of the richest men in Europe.&nbsp;
He could buy all London to-morrow without overdrawing his account.&nbsp;
He has a house in every capital, dines off gold plate, and can prevent
Russia going to war when he chooses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What on earth do you mean?&rsquo; exclaimed Hughie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I say,&rsquo; said Trevor.&nbsp; &lsquo;The old man you
saw to-day in the studio was Baron Hausberg.&nbsp; He is a great friend
of mine, buys all my pictures and that sort of thing, and gave me a
commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar.&nbsp; <i>Que voulez-vous</i>?&nbsp;
<i>La fantaisie d&rsquo;un millionnaire</i>!&nbsp; And I must say he
made a magnificent figure in his rags, or perhaps I should say in my
rags; they are an old suit I got in Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baron Hausberg!&rsquo; cried Hughie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good heavens!&nbsp;
I gave him a sovereign!&rsquo; and he sank into an armchair the picture
of dismay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gave him a sovereign!&rsquo; shouted Trevor, and he burst
into a roar of laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear boy, you&rsquo;ll never
see it again.&nbsp; <i>Son affaire c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;argent des autres</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you might have told me, Alan,&rsquo; said Hughie sulkily,
&lsquo;and not have let me make such a fool of myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to begin with, Hughie,&rsquo; said Trevor, &lsquo;it
never entered my mind that you went about distributing alms in that
reckless way.&nbsp; I can understand your kissing a pretty model, but
your giving a sovereign to an ugly one - by Jove, no!&nbsp; Besides,
the fact is that I really was not at home to-day to any one; and when
you came in I didn&rsquo;t know whether Hausberg would like his name
mentioned.&nbsp; You know he wasn&rsquo;t in full dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a duffer he must think me!&rsquo; said Hughie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; He was in the highest spirits after you
left; kept chuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t make out why he was so interested to know all about
you; but I see it all now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll invest your sovereign for
you, Hughie, pay you the interest every six months, and have a capital
story to tell after dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am an unlucky devil,&rsquo; growled Hughie.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
best thing I can do is to go to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn&rsquo;t
tell any one.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t dare show my face in the Row.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; It reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic
spirit, Hughie.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t run away.&nbsp; Have another cigarette,
and you can talk about Laura as much as you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, Hughie wouldn&rsquo;t stop, but walked home, feeling very
unhappy, and leaving Alan Trevor in fits of laughter.</p>
<p>The next morning, as he was at breakfast, the servant brought him
up a card on which was written, &lsquo;Monsieur Gustave Naudin, <i>de
la</i> <i>part de</i> M. le Baron Hausberg.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose
he has come for an apology,&rsquo; said Hughie to himself; and he told
the servant to show the visitor up.</p>
<p>An old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the
room, and said, in a slight French accent, &lsquo;Have I the honour
of addressing Monsieur Erskine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hughie bowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come from Baron Hausberg,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Baron - &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg, sir, that you will offer him my sincerest apologies,&rsquo;
stammered Hughie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Baron,&rsquo; said the old gentleman with a smile, &lsquo;has
commissioned me to bring you this letter&rsquo;; and he extended a sealed
envelope.</p>
<p>On the outside was written, &lsquo;A wedding present to Hugh Erskine
and Laura Merton, from an old beggar,&rsquo; and inside was a cheque
for &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>When they were married Alan Trevor was the best man, and the Baron
made a speech at the wedding breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Millionaire models,&rsquo; remarked Alan, &lsquo;are rare
enough; but, by Jove, model millionaires are rarer still!&rsquo;</p>

<h2>THE PORTRAIT OF MR. W. H.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I had been dining with Erskine in his pretty little house in Birdcage
Walk, and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes,
when the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in conversation.&nbsp;
I cannot at present remember how it was that we struck upon this somewhat
curious topic, as it was at that time, but I know that we had a long
discussion about Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton, and that with
regard to the last I insisted that his so-called forgeries were merely
the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that we
had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which
he chooses to present his work; and that all Art being to a certain
degree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one&rsquo;s own personality
on some imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents
and limitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was
to confuse an ethical with an aesthetical problem.</p>
<p>Erskine, who was a good deal older than I was, and had been listening
to me with the amused deference of a man of forty, suddenly put his
hand upon my shoulder and said to me, &lsquo;What would you say about
a young man who had a strange theory about a certain work of art, believed
in his theory, and committed a forgery in order to prove it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! that is quite a different matter,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>Erskine remained silent for a few moments, looking at the thin grey
threads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
he said, after a pause, &lsquo;quite different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the tone of his voice, a slight touch of bitterness
perhaps, that excited my curiosity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever know anybody
who did that?&rsquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, throwing his cigarette into the fire,
- &lsquo;a great friend of mine, Cyril Graham.&nbsp; He was very fascinating,
and very foolish, and very heartless.&nbsp; However, he left me the
only legacy I ever received in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; Erskine rose from
his seat, and going over to a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between
the two windows, unlocked it, and came back to where I was sitting,
holding in his hand a small panel picture set in an old and somewhat
tarnished Elizabethan frame.</p>
<p>It was a full-length portrait of a young man in late sixteenth-century
costume, standing by a table, with his right hand resting on an open
book.&nbsp; He seemed about seventeen years of age, and was of quite
extraordinary personal beauty, though evidently somewhat effeminate.&nbsp;
Indeed, had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair,
one would have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes, and
its delicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl.&nbsp; In manner,
and especially in the treatment of the hands, the picture reminded one
of Fran&ccedil;ois Clouet&rsquo;s later work.&nbsp; The black velvet
doublet with its fantastically gilded points, and the peacock-blue background
against which it showed up so pleasantly, and from which it gained such
luminous value of colour, were quite in Clouet&rsquo;s style; and the
two masks of Tragedy and Comedy that hung somewhat formally from the
marble pedestal had that hard severity of touch - so different from
the facile grace of the Italians - which even at the Court of France
the great Flemish master never completely lost, and which in itself
has always been a characteristic of the northern temper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a charming thing,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;but who is
this wonderful young man, whose beauty Art has so happily preserved
for us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the portrait of Mr. W. H.,&rsquo; said Erskine, with
a sad smile.&nbsp; It might have been a chance effect of light, but
it seemed to me that his eyes were quite bright with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. W. H.!&rsquo; I exclaimed; &lsquo;who was Mr. W. H.?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;look
at the book on which his hand is resting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see there is some writing there, but I cannot make it out,&rsquo;
I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take this magnifying-glass and try,&rsquo; said Erskine, with
the same sad smile still playing about his mouth.</p>
<p>I took the glass, and moving the lamp a little nearer, I began to
spell out the crabbed sixteenth-century handwriting.&nbsp; &lsquo;To
the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;Good
heavens!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;is this Shakespeare&rsquo;s Mr. W. H.?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cyril Graham used to say so,&rsquo; muttered Erskine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not a bit like Lord Pembroke,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know the Penshurst portraits very well.&nbsp; I was staying
near there a few weeks ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed
to Lord Pembroke?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure of it,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pembroke,
Shakespeare, and Mrs. Mary Fitton are the three personages of the Sonnets;
there is no doubt at all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I agree with you,&rsquo; said Erskine, &lsquo;but I
did not always think so.&nbsp; I used to believe - well, I suppose I
used to believe in Cyril Graham and his theory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what was that?&rsquo; I asked, looking at the wonderful
portrait, which had already begun to have a strange fascination for
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a long story,&rsquo; said Erskine, taking the picture
away from me - rather abruptly I thought at the time - &lsquo;a very
long story; but if you care to hear it, I will tell it to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love theories about the Sonnets,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;but
I don&rsquo;t think I am likely to be converted to any new idea.&nbsp;
The matter has ceased to be a mystery to any one.&nbsp; Indeed, I wonder
that it ever was a mystery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I don&rsquo;t believe in the theory, I am not likely to
convert you to it,&rsquo; said Erskine, laughing; &lsquo;but it may
interest you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell it to me, of course,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
it is half as delightful as the picture, I shall be more than satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, &lsquo;I
must begin by telling you about Cyril Graham himself.&nbsp; He and I
were at the same house at Eton.&nbsp; I was a year or two older than
he was, but we were immense friends, and did all our work and all our
play together.&nbsp; There was, of course, a good deal more play than
work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that.&nbsp; It is always
an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education, and
what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful
to me as anything I was taught at Cambridge.&nbsp; I should tell you
that Cyril&rsquo;s father and mother were both dead.&nbsp; They had
been drowned in a horrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight.&nbsp;
His father had been in the diplomatic service, and had married a daughter,
the only daughter, in fact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril&rsquo;s
guardian after the death of his parents.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that
Lord Crediton cared very much for Cyril.&nbsp; He had never really forgiven
his daughter for marrying a man who had not a title.&nbsp; He was an
extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like a costermonger, and had
the manners of a farmer.&nbsp; I remember seeing him once on Speech-day.&nbsp;
He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me not to grow up &ldquo;a
damned Radical&rdquo; like my father.&nbsp; Cyril had very little affection
for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays with us
in Scotland.&nbsp; They never really got on together at all.&nbsp; Cyril
thought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.&nbsp; He was effeminate,
I suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital
fencer.&nbsp; In fact he got the foils before he left Eton.&nbsp; But
he was very languid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good
looks, and had a strong objection to football.&nbsp; The two things
that really gave him pleasure were poetry and acting.&nbsp; At Eton
he was always dressing up and reciting Shakespeare, and when we went
up to Trinity he became a member of the A.D.C. his first term.&nbsp;
I remember I was always very jealous of his acting.&nbsp; I was absurdly
devoted to him; I suppose because we were so different in some things.&nbsp;
I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge feet, and horribly freckled.&nbsp;
Freckles run in Scotch families just as gout does in English families.&nbsp;
Cyril used to say that of the two he preferred the gout; but he always
set an absurdly high value on personal appearance, and once read a paper
before our debating society to prove that it was better to be good-looking
than to be good.&nbsp; He certainly was wonderfully handsome.&nbsp;
People who did not like him, Philistines and college tutors, and young
men reading for the Church, used to say that he was merely pretty; but
there was a great deal more in his face than mere prettiness.&nbsp;
I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and nothing could
exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner.&nbsp; He
fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many people
who were not.&nbsp; He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to
think him dreadfully insincere.&nbsp; It was due, I think, chiefly to
his inordinate desire to please.&nbsp; Poor Cyril!&nbsp; I told him
once that he was contented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed.&nbsp;
He was horribly spoiled.&nbsp; All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled.&nbsp;
It is the secret of their attraction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, I must tell you about Cyril&rsquo;s acting.&nbsp;
You know that no actresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C.&nbsp; At
least they were not in my time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it is now.&nbsp;
Well, of course, Cyril was always cast for the girls&rsquo; parts, and
when <i>As You Like It</i> was produced he played Rosalind.&nbsp; It
was a marvellous performance.&nbsp; In fact, Cyril Graham was the only
perfect Rosalind I have ever seen.&nbsp; It would be impossible to describe
to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole thing.&nbsp;
It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as it was
then, was crowded every night.&nbsp; Even when I read the play now I
can&rsquo;t help thinking of Cyril.&nbsp; It might have been written
for him.&nbsp; The next term he took his degree, and came to London
to read for the diplomatic.&nbsp; But he never did any work.&nbsp; He
spent his days in reading Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets, and his evenings
at the theatre.&nbsp; He was, of course, wild to go on the stage.&nbsp;
It was all that I and Lord Crediton could do to prevent him.&nbsp; Perhaps
if he had gone on the stage he would be alive now.&nbsp; It is always
a silly thing to give advice, but to give good advice is absolutely
fatal.&nbsp; I hope you will never fall into that error.&nbsp; If you
do, you will be sorry for it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to come to the real point of the story, one day I got
a letter from Cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening.&nbsp;
He had charming chambers in Piccadilly overlooking the Green Park, and
as I used to go to see him every day, I was rather surprised at his
taking the trouble to write.&nbsp; Of course I went, and when I arrived
I found him in a state of great excitement.&nbsp; He told me that he
had at last discovered the true secret of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets;
that all the scholars and critics had been entirely on the wrong tack;
and that he was the first who, working purely by internal evidence,
had found out who Mr. W. H. really was.&nbsp; He was perfectly wild
with delight, and for a long time would not tell me his theory.&nbsp;
Finally, he produced a bundle of notes, took his copy of the Sonnets
off the mantelpiece, and sat down and gave me a long lecture on the
whole subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He began by pointing out that the young man to whom Shakespeare
addressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who
was a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art, and
that this could not be said either of Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton.&nbsp;
Indeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth,
as was shown very clearly by the 25th Sonnet, in which Shakespeare contrasting
himself with those who are &ldquo;great princes&rsquo; favourites,&rdquo;
says quite frankly -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Let those who are in favour with their stars<br />Of public honour
and proud titles boast,<br />Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph
bars,<br />Unlook&rsquo;d for joy in that I honour most.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of
him he so adored.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Then happy I, that love and am beloved<br />Where I may not remove
nor be removed.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This sonnet Cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied
that it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of
Southampton, both of whom were men of the highest position in England
and fully entitled to be called &ldquo;great princes&rdquo;; and he
in corroboration of his view read me Sonnets CXXIV. and CXXV., in which
Shakespeare tells us that his love is not &ldquo;the child of state,&rdquo;
that it &ldquo;suffers not in smiling pomp,&rdquo; but is &ldquo;builded
far from accident.&rdquo;&nbsp; I listened with a good deal of interest,
for I don&rsquo;t think the point had ever been made before; but what
followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the time to dispose
entirely of Pembroke&rsquo;s claim.&nbsp; We know from Meres that the
Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV. informs us that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s friendship for Mr. W. H. had been already in existence
for three years.&nbsp; Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did
not come to London till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say
till 1598, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s acquaintance with Mr. W. H. must
have begun in 1594, or at the latest in 1595.&nbsp; Shakespeare, accordingly,
could not have known Lord Pembroke till after the Sonnets had been written.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cyril pointed out also that Pembroke&rsquo;s father did not
die till 1601; whereas it was evident from the line,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>You had a father; let your son say so,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>that the father of Mr. W. H. was dead in 1598.&nbsp; Besides, it
was absurd to imagine that any publisher of the time, and the preface
is from the publisher&rsquo;s hand, would have ventured to address William
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, as Mr. W. H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst
being spoken of as Mr. Sackville being not really a parallel instance,
as Lord Buckhurst was not a peer, but merely the younger son of a peer,
with a courtesy title, and the passage in <i>England&rsquo;s Parnassus</i>,
where he is so spoken of, is not a formal and stately dedication, but
simply a casual allusion.&nbsp; So far for Lord Pembroke, whose supposed
claims Cyril easily demolished while I sat by in wonder.&nbsp; With
Lord Southampton Cyril had even less difficulty.&nbsp; Southampton became
at a very early age the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so he needed no entreaties
to marry; he was not beautiful; he did not resemble his mother, as Mr.
W. H. did -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thou art thy mother&rsquo;s glass, and she in thee<br />Calls back
the lovely April of her prime;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and, above all, his Christian name was Henry, whereas the punning
sonnets (CXXXV. and CXLIII.) show that the Christian name of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
friend was the same as his own - <i>Will</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators,
that Mr. W. H. is a misprint for Mr. W. S., meaning Mr. William Shakespeare;
that &ldquo;Mr. W. H. all&rdquo; should be read &ldquo;Mr. W. Hall&rdquo;;
that Mr. W. H. is Mr. William Hathaway; and that a full stop should
be placed after &ldquo;wisheth,&rdquo; making Mr. W. H. the writer and
not the subject of the dedication, - Cyril got rid of them in a very
short time; and it is not worth while to mention his reasons, though
I remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by reading to me, I
am glad to say not in the original, some extracts from a German commentator
called Barnstorff, who insisted that Mr. W. H. was no less a person
than &ldquo;Mr. William Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor would he allow for
a moment that the Sonnets are mere satires on the work of Drayton and
John Davies of Hereford.&nbsp; To him, as indeed to me, they were poems
of serious and tragic import, wrung out of the bitterness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
heart, and made sweet by the honey of his lips.&nbsp; Still less would
he admit that they were merely a philosophical allegory, and that in
them Shakespeare is addressing his Ideal Self, or Ideal Manhood, or
the Spirit of Beauty, or the Reason, or the Divine Logos, or the Catholic
Church.&nbsp; He felt, as indeed I think we all must feel, that the
Sonnets are addressed to an individual, - to a particular young man
whose personality for some reason seems to have filled the soul of Shakespeare
with terrible joy and no less terrible despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having in this manner cleared the way as it were, Cyril asked
me to dismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas I might have formed
on the subject, and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own
theory.&nbsp; The problem he pointed out was this: Who was that young
man of Shakespeare&rsquo;s day who, without being of noble birth or
even of noble nature, was addressed by him in terms of such passionate
adoration that we can but wonder at the strange worship, and are almost
afraid to turn the key that unlocks the mystery of the poet&rsquo;s
heart?&nbsp; Who was he whose physical beauty was such that it became
the very corner-stone of Shakespeare&rsquo;s art; the very source of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s inspiration; the very incarnation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
dreams?&nbsp; To look upon him as simply the object of certain love-poems
is to miss the whole meaning of the poems: for the art of which Shakespeare
talks in the Sonnets is not the art of the Sonnets themselves, which
indeed were to him but slight and secret things - it is the art of the
dramatist to which he is always alluding; and he to whom Shakespeare
said -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Thou art all my art, and dost advance<br />As high as learning my
rude ignorance,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>he to whom he promised immortality,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men, -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>was surely none other than the boy-actor for whom he created Viola
and Imogen, Juliet and Rosalind, Portia and Desdemona, and Cleopatra
herself.&nbsp; This was Cyril Graham&rsquo;s theory, evolved as you
see purely from the Sonnets themselves, and depending for its acceptance
not so much on demonstrable proof or formal evidence, but on a kind
of spiritual and artistic sense, by which alone he claimed could the
true meaning of the poems be discerned.&nbsp; I remember his reading
to me that fine sonnet -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>How can my Muse want subject to invent,<br />While thou dost breathe,
that pour&rsquo;st into my verse<br />Thine own sweet argument, too
excellent<br />For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br />O, give thyself
the thanks, if aught in me<br />Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<br />For
who&rsquo;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br />When thou thyself
dost give invention light?<br />Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more
in worth<br />Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<br />And he
that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br />Eternal numbers to outlive
long date -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory; and indeed
he went through all the Sonnets carefully, and showed, or fancied that
he showed, that, according to his new explanation of their meaning,
things that had seemed obscure, or evil, or exaggerated, became clear
and rational, and of high artistic import, illustrating Shakespeare&rsquo;s
conception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the
art of the dramatist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of course evident that there must have been in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
company some wonderful boy-actor of great beauty, to whom he intrusted
the presentation of his noble heroines; for Shakespeare was a practical
theatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet, and Cyril Graham
had actually discovered the boy-actor&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; He was Will,
or, as he preferred to call him, Willie Hughes.&nbsp; The Christian
name he found of course in the punning sonnets, CXXXV. and CXLIII.;
the surname was, according to him, hidden in the seventh line of the
20th Sonnet, where Mr. W. H. is described as -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A man in hew, all <i>Hews</i> in his controwling.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&lsquo;In the original edition of the Sonnets &ldquo;Hews&rdquo;
is printed with a capital letter and in italics, and this, he claimed,
showed clearly that a play on words was intended, his view receiving
a good deal of corroboration from those sonnets in which curious puns
are made on the words &ldquo;use&rdquo; and &ldquo;usury.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Of course I was converted at once, and Willie Hughes became to me as
real a person as Shakespeare.&nbsp; The only objection I made to the
theory was that the name of Willie Hughes does not occur in the list
of the actors of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company as it is printed in the
first folio.&nbsp; Cyril, however, pointed out that the absence of Willie
Hughes&rsquo;s name from this list really corroborated the theory, as
it was evident from Sonnet LXXXVI. that Willie Hughes had abandoned
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company to play at a rival theatre, probably in
some of Chapman&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; It is in reference to this that
in the great sonnet on Chapman, Shakespeare said to Willie Hughes -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But when your countenance fill&rsquo;d up his line,<br />Then lack&rsquo;d
I matter; that enfeebled mine -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>the expression &ldquo;when your countenance filled up his line&rdquo;
referring obviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and
reality and added charm to Chapman&rsquo;s verse, the same idea being
also put forward in the 79th Sonnet -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<br />My verse alone had all
thy gentle grace;<br />But now my gracious numbers are decay&rsquo;d,<br />And
my sick Muse doth give another place;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and in the immediately preceding sonnet, where Shakespeare says -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Every alien pen has got my <i>use<br /></i>And under thee their poesy
disperse,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>the play upon words (use=Hughes) being of course obvious, and the
phrase &ldquo;under thee their poesy disperse,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;by
your assistance as an actor bring their plays before the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a wonderful evening, and we sat up almost till dawn
reading and re-reading the Sonnets.&nbsp; After some time, however,
I began to see that before the theory could be placed before the world
in a really perfected form, it was necessary to get some independent
evidence about the existence of this young actor, Willie Hughes.&nbsp;
If this could be once established, there could be no possible doubt
about his identity with Mr. W. H.; but otherwise the theory would fall
to the ground.&nbsp; I put this forward very strongly to Cyril, who
was a good deal annoyed at what he called my Philistine tone of mind,
and indeed was rather bitter upon the subject.&nbsp; However, I made
him promise that in his own interest he would not publish his discovery
till he had put the whole matter beyond the reach of doubt; and for
weeks and weeks we searched the registers of City churches, the Alleyn
MSS. at Dulwich, the Record Office, the papers of the Lord Chamberlain
- everything, in fact, that we thought might contain some allusion to
Willie Hughes.&nbsp; We discovered nothing, of course, and every day
the existence of Willie Hughes seemed to me to become more problematical.&nbsp;
Cyril was in a dreadful state, and used to go over the whole question
day after day, entreating me to believe; but I saw the one flaw in the
theory, and I refused to be convinced till the actual existence of Willie
Hughes, a boy-actor of Elizabethan days, had been placed beyond the
reach of doubt or cavil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day Cyril left town to stay with his grandfather, I thought
at the time, but I afterwards heard from Lord Crediton that this was
not the case; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram
from him, handed in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine
with him that evening at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; When I arrived,
he said to me, &ldquo;The only apostle who did not deserve proof was
St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the only apostle who got it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I asked him what he meant.&nbsp; He answered that he had not merely
been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth century of a boy-actor
of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the most conclusive evidence
that he was the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.&nbsp; He would not tell me
anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly produced the
picture I showed you, and told me that he had discovered it by the merest
chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse
in Warwickshire.&nbsp; The chest itself, which was a very fine example
of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with him, and in the
centre of the front panel the initials W. H. were undoubtedly carved.&nbsp;
It was this monogram that had attracted his attention, and he told me
that it was not till he had had the chest in his possession for several
days that he had thought of making any careful examination of the inside.&nbsp;
One morning, however, he saw that one of the sides of the chest was
much thicker than the other, and looking more closely, he discovered
that a framed panel picture was clamped against it.&nbsp; On taking
it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on the sofa.&nbsp;
It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to clean it,
and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the
one thing for which he had been looking.&nbsp; Here was an authentic
portrait of Mr. W. H., with his hand resting on the dedicatory page
of the Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name
of the young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground,
&ldquo;Master Will. Hews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what was I to say?&nbsp; It never occurred to me for
a moment that Cyril Graham was playing a trick on me, or that he was
trying to prove his theory by means of a forgery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is it a forgery?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is,&rsquo; said Erskine.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a
very good forgery; but it is a forgery none the less.&nbsp; I thought
at the time that Cyril was rather calm about the whole matter; but I
remember he more than once told me that he himself required no proof
of the kind, and that he thought the theory complete without it.&nbsp;
I laughed at him, and told him that without it the theory would fall
to the ground, and I warmly congratulated him on the marvellous discovery.&nbsp;
We then arranged that the picture should be etched or facsimiled, and
placed as the frontispiece to Cyril&rsquo;s edition of the Sonnets;
and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line by line,
till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning.&nbsp; One unlucky
day I was in a print-shop in Holborn, when I saw upon the counter some
extremely beautiful drawings in silver-point.&nbsp; I was so attracted
by them that I bought them; and the proprietor of the place, a man called
Rawlings, told me that they were done by a young painter of the name
of Edward Merton, who was very clever, but as poor as a church mouse.&nbsp;
I went to see Merton some days afterwards, having got his address from
the printseller, and found a pale, interesting young man, with a rather
common-looking wife - his model, as I subsequently learned.&nbsp; I
told him how much I admired his drawings, at which he seemed very pleased,
and I asked him if he would show me some of his other work.&nbsp; As
we were looking over a portfolio, full of really very lovely things,
- for Merton had a most delicate and delightful touch, - I suddenly
caught sight of a drawing of the picture of Mr. W. H.&nbsp; There was
no doubt whatever about it.&nbsp; It was almost a <i>facsimile</i> -
the only difference being that the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy were
not suspended from the marble table as they are in the picture, but
were lying on the floor at the young man&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
on earth did you get that?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; He grew rather confused,
and said - &ldquo;Oh, that is nothing.&nbsp; I did not know it was in
this portfolio.&nbsp; It is not a thing of any value.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is what you did for Mr. Cyril Graham,&rdquo; exclaimed his wife; &ldquo;and
if this gentleman wishes to buy it, let him have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
Mr. Cyril Graham?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you paint the
picture of Mr. W. H.?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what
you mean,&rdquo; he answered, growing very red.&nbsp; Well, the whole
thing was quite dreadful.&nbsp; The wife let it all out.&nbsp; I gave
her five pounds when I was going away.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear to think
of it now; but of course I was furious.&nbsp; I went off at once to
Cyril&rsquo;s chambers, waited there for three hours before he came
in, with that horrid lie staring me in the face, and told him I had
discovered his forgery.&nbsp; He grew very pale and said - &ldquo;I
did it purely for your sake.&nbsp; You would not be convinced in any
other way.&nbsp; It does not affect the truth of the theory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The truth of the theory!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;the less
we talk about that the better.&nbsp; You never even believed in it yourself.&nbsp;
If you had, you would not have committed a forgery to prove it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
High words passed between us; we had a fearful quarrel.&nbsp; I dare
say I was unjust.&nbsp; The next morning he was dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; I cried,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he shot himself with a revolver.&nbsp; Some of the blood
splashed upon the frame of the picture, just where the name had been
painted.&nbsp; By the time I arrived - his servant had sent for me at
once - the police were already there.&nbsp; He had left a letter for
me, evidently written in the greatest agitation and distress of mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was in it?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that he believed absolutely in Willie Hughes; that the
forgery of the picture had been done simply as a concession to me, and
did not in the slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory;
and, that in order to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the
whole thing was, he was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the
secret of the Sonnets.&nbsp; It was a foolish, mad letter.&nbsp; I remember
he ended by saying that he intrusted to me the Willie Hughes theory,
and that it was for me to present it to the world, and to unlock the
secret of Shakespeare&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a most tragic story,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;but why
have you not carried out his wishes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Erskine shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because it is a perfectly
unsound theory from beginning to end,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Erskine,&rsquo; I said, getting up from my seat, &lsquo;you
are entirely wrong about the whole matter.&nbsp; It is the only perfect
key to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets that has ever been made.&nbsp; It
is complete in every detail.&nbsp; I believe in Willie Hughes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo; said Erskine gravely; &lsquo;I
believe there is something fatal about the idea, and intellectually
there is nothing to be said for it.&nbsp; I have gone into the whole
matter, and I assure you the theory is entirely fallacious.&nbsp; It
is plausible up to a certain point.&nbsp; Then it stops.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s
sake, my dear boy, don&rsquo;t take up the subject of Willie Hughes.&nbsp;
You will break your heart over it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Erskine,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;it is your duty to give
this theory to the world.&nbsp; If you will not do it, I will.&nbsp;
By keeping it back you wrong the memory of Cyril Graham, the youngest
and the most splendid of all the martyrs of literature.&nbsp; I entreat
you to do him justice.&nbsp; He died for this thing, - don&rsquo;t let
his death be in vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Erskine looked at me in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are carried away
by the sentiment of the whole story,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
forget that a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.&nbsp;
I was devoted to Cyril Graham.&nbsp; His death was a horrible blow to
me.&nbsp; I did not recover it for years.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
I have ever recovered it.&nbsp; But Willie Hughes?&nbsp; There is nothing
in the idea of Willie Hughes.&nbsp; No such person ever existed.&nbsp;
As for bringing the whole thing before the world - the world thinks
that Cyril Graham shot himself by accident.&nbsp; The only proof of
his suicide was contained in the letter to me, and of this letter the
public never heard anything.&nbsp; To the present day Lord Crediton
thinks that the whole thing was accidental.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cyril Graham sacrificed his life to a great Idea,&rsquo; I
answered; &lsquo;and if you will not tell of his martyrdom, tell at
least of his faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His faith,&rsquo; said Erskine, &lsquo;was fixed in a thing
that was false, in a thing that was unsound, in a thing that no Shakespearean
scholar would accept for a moment.&nbsp; The theory would be laughed
at.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself, and don&rsquo;t follow
a trail that leads nowhere.&nbsp; You start by assuming the existence
of the very person whose existence is the thing to be proved.&nbsp;
Besides, everybody knows that the Sonnets were addressed to Lord Pembroke.&nbsp;
The matter is settled once for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The matter is not settled!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
will take up the theory where Cyril Graham left it, and I will prove
to the world that he was right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly boy!&rsquo; said Erskine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go home: it is
after two, and don&rsquo;t think about Willie Hughes any more.&nbsp;
I am sorry I told you anything about it, and very sorry indeed that
I should have converted you to a thing in which I don&rsquo;t believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern
literature,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;and I shall not rest till I have
made you recognise, till I have made everybody recognise, that Cyril
Graham was the most subtle Shakespearean critic of our day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I walked home through St. James&rsquo;s Park the dawn was just
breaking over London.&nbsp; The white swans were lying asleep on the
polished lake, and the gaunt Palace looked purple against the pale-green
sky.&nbsp; I thought of Cyril Graham, and my eyes filled with tears.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was past twelve o&rsquo;clock when I awoke, and the sun was streaming
in through the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold.&nbsp;
I told my servant that I would be at home to no one; and after I had
had a cup of chocolate and a <i>petit-pain</i>, I took down from the
book-shelf my copy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets, and began to go carefully
through them.&nbsp; Every poem seemed to me to corroborate Cyril Graham&rsquo;s
theory.&nbsp; I felt as if I had my hand upon Shakespeare&rsquo;s heart,
and was counting each separate throb and pulse of passion.&nbsp; I thought
of the wonderful boy-actor, and saw his face in every line.</p>
<p>Two sonnets, I remember, struck me particularly: they were the 53rd
and the 67th.&nbsp; In the first of these, Shakespeare, complimenting
Willie Hughes on the versatility of his acting, on his wide range of
parts, a range extending from Rosalind to Juliet, and from Beatrice
to Ophelia, says to him -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>What is your substance, whereof are you made,<br />That millions
of strange shadows on you tend?<br />Since every one hath, every one,
one shade,<br />And you, but one, can every shadow lend -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>lines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to
an actor, for the word &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; had in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
day a technical meaning connected with the stage.&nbsp; &lsquo;The best
in this kind are but shadows,&rsquo; says Theseus of the actors in the
<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, and there are many similar allusions
in the literature of the day.&nbsp; These sonnets evidently belonged
to the series in which Shakespeare discusses the nature of the actor&rsquo;s
art, and of the strange and rare temperament that is essential to the
perfect stage-player.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is it,&rsquo; says Shakespeare
to Willie Hughes, &lsquo;that you have so many personalities?&rsquo;
and then he goes on to point out that his beauty is such that it seems
to realise every form and phase of fancy, to embody each dream of the
creative imagination - an idea that is still further expanded in the
sonnet that immediately follows, where, beginning with the fine thought,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<br />By that sweet ornament
which <i>truth</i> doth give!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Shakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting, the truth
of visible presentation on the stage, adds to the wonder of poetry,
giving life to its loveliness, and actual reality to its ideal form.&nbsp;
And yet, in the 67th Sonnet, Shakespeare calls upon Willie Hughes to
abandon the stage with its artificiality, its false mimic life of painted
face and unreal costume, its immoral influences and suggestions, its
remoteness from the true world of noble action and sincere utterance.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ah, wherefore with infection should he live<br />And with his presence
grace impiety,<br />That sin by him advantage should achieve<br />And
lace itself with his society?<br />Why should false painting imitate
his cheek,<br />And steal dead seeming of his living hue?<br />Why should
poor beauty indirectly seek<br />Roses of shadow, since his rose is
true?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It may seem strange that so great a dramatist as Shakespeare, who
realised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on
the ideal plane of stage-writing and stage-playing, should have written
in these terms about the theatre; but we must remember that in Sonnets
CX. and CXI. Shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world
of puppets, and full of shame at having made himself &lsquo;a motley
to the view.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 111th Sonnet is especially bitter:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,<br />The guilty goddess
of my harmful deeds,<br />That did not better for my life provide<br />Than
public means which public manners breeds.<br />Thence comes it that
my name receives a brand,<br />And almost thence my nature is subdued<br />To
what it works in, like the dyer&rsquo;s hand:<br />Pity me then and
wish I were renew&rsquo;d -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and there are many signs elsewhere of the same feeling, signs familiar
to all real students of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>One point puzzled me immensely as I read the Sonnets, and it was
days before I struck on the true interpretation, which indeed Cyril
Graham himself seems to have missed.&nbsp; I could not understand how
it was that Shakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying.&nbsp;
He himself had married young, and the result had been unhappiness, and
it was not likely that he would have asked Willie Hughes to commit the
same error.&nbsp; The boy-player of Rosalind had nothing to gain from
marriage, or from the passions of real life.&nbsp; The early sonnets,
with their strange entreaties to have children, seemed to me a jarring
note.&nbsp; The explanation of the mystery came on me quite suddenly,
and I found it in the curious dedication.&nbsp; It will be remembered
that the dedication runs as follows:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;TO THE ONLIE BEGETTER OF</p>
<p>&nbsp;THESE INSUING SONNETS</p>
<p>&nbsp;MR. W. H. ALL HAPPINESSE</p>
<p>AND THAT ETERNITIE</p>
<p>PROMISED</p>
<p>BY</p>
<p>OUR EVER-LIVING POET</p>
<p>WISHETH</p>
<p>THE WELL-WISHING</p>
<p>ADVENTURER IN</p>
<p>SETTING</p>
<p>FORTH.</p>
<p>T. T.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Some scholars have supposed that the word &lsquo;begetter&rsquo;
in this dedication means simply the procurer of the Sonnets for Thomas
Thorpe the publisher; but this view is now generally abandoned, and
the highest authorities are quite agreed that it is to be taken in the
sense of inspirer, the metaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical
life.&nbsp; Now I saw that the same metaphor was used by Shakespeare
himself all through the poems, and this set me on the right track.&nbsp;
Finally I made my great discovery.&nbsp; The marriage that Shakespeare
proposes for Willie Hughes is the marriage with his Muse, an expression
which is definitely put forward in the 82nd Sonnet, where, in the bitterness
of his heart at the defection of the boy-actor for whom he had written
his greatest parts, and whose beauty had indeed suggested them, he opens
his complaint by saying -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood,
but more immortal children of undying fame.&nbsp; The whole cycle of
the early sonnets is simply Shakespeare&rsquo;s invitation to Willie
Hughes to go upon the stage and become a player.&nbsp; How barren and
profitless a thing, he says, is this beauty of yours if it be not used:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow<br />And dig deep trenches
in thy beauty&rsquo;s field,<br />Thy youth&rsquo;s proud livery, so
gazed on now,<br />Will be a tatter&rsquo;d weed, of small worth held:<br />Then
being ask&rsquo;d where all thy beauty lies,<br />Where all the treasure
of thy lusty days,<br />To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,<br />Were
an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>You must create something in art: my verse &lsquo;is thine, and <i>born</i>
of thee&rsquo;; only listen to me, and I will &lsquo;<i>bring forth</i>
eternal numbers to outlive long date,&rsquo; and you shall people with
forms of your own image the imaginary world of the stage.&nbsp; These
children that you beget, he continues, will not wither away, as mortal
children do, but you shall live in them and in my plays: do but -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Make thee another self, for love of me,<br />That beauty still may
live in thine or thee.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>I collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this
view, and they produced a strong impression on me, and showed me how
complete Cyril Graham&rsquo;s theory really was.&nbsp; I also saw that
it was quite easy to separate those lines in which he speaks of the
Sonnets themselves from those in which he speaks of his great dramatic
work.&nbsp; This was a point that had been entirely overlooked by all
critics up to Cyril Graham&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; And yet it was one of
the most important points in the whole series of poems.&nbsp; To the
Sonnets Shakespeare was more or less indifferent.&nbsp; He did not wish
to rest his fame on them.&nbsp; They were to him his &lsquo;slight Muse,&rsquo;
as he calls them, and intended, as Meres tells us, for private circulation
only among a few, a very few, friends.&nbsp; Upon the other hand he
was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays, and
shows a noble self-reliance upon his dramatic genius.&nbsp; When he
says to Willie Hughes:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />Nor lose possession of
that fair thou owest;<br />Nor shall Death brag thou wander&rsquo;st
in his shade,<br />When in <i>eternal lines</i> to time thou grow&rsquo;st:<br />So
long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />So long lives this, and
this gives life to thee; -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>the expression &lsquo;eternal lines&rsquo; clearly alludes to one
of his plays that he was sending him at the time, just as the concluding
couplet points to his confidence in the probability of his plays being
always acted.&nbsp; In his address to the Dramatic Muse (Sonnets C.
and CI.), we find the same feeling.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget&rsquo;st so long<br />To speak
of that which gives thee all thy might?<br />Spend&rsquo;st thou thy
fury on some worthless song,<br />Darkening thy power to lend base subjects
light?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>he cries, and he then proceeds to reproach the Mistress of Tragedy
and Comedy for her &lsquo;neglect of Truth in Beauty dyed,&rsquo; and
says -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<br />Excuse not silence
so, for &lsquo;t lies in thee<br />To make him much outlive a gilded
tomb<br />And to be praised of ages yet to be.<br />Then do thy office,
Muse; I teach thee how<br />To make him seem long hence as he shows
now.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It is, however, perhaps in the 55th Sonnet that Shakespeare gives
to this idea its fullest expression.&nbsp; To imagine that the &lsquo;powerful
rhyme&rsquo; of the second line refers to the sonnet itself, is to mistake
Shakespeare&rsquo;s meaning entirely.&nbsp; It seemed to me that it
was extremely likely, from the general character of the sonnet, that
a particular play was meant, and that the play was none other but <i>Romeo
and Juliet.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br />Of princes, shall outlive
this powerful rhyme;<br />But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br />Than
unswept stone besmear&rsquo;d with sluttish time.<br />When wasteful
wars shall statues overturn,<br />And broils root out the work of masonry,<br />Nor
Mars his sword nor war&rsquo;s quick fire shall burn<br />The living
record of your memory.<br />&lsquo;Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br />Shall
you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br />Even in the eyes
of all posterity<br />That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br />So,
till the judgement that yourself arise,<br />You live in this, and dwell
in lovers&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>It was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere Shakespeare
promised Willie Hughes immortality in a form that appealed to men&rsquo;s
eyes - that is to say, in a spectacular form, in a play that is to be
looked at.</p>
<p>For two weeks I worked hard at the Sonnets, hardly ever going out,
and refusing all invitations.&nbsp; Every day I seemed to be discovering
something new, and Willie Hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence,
an ever-dominant personality.&nbsp; I could almost fancy that I saw
him standing in the shadow of my room, so well had Shakespeare drawn
him, with his golden hair, his tender flower-like grace, his dreamy
deep-sunken eyes, his delicate mobile limbs, and his white lily hands.&nbsp;
His very name fascinated me.&nbsp; Willie Hughes!&nbsp; Willie Hughes!&nbsp;
How musically it sounded!&nbsp; Yes; who else but he could have been
the master-mistress of Shakespeare&rsquo;s passion, <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage, <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>
the delicate minion of pleasure, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>
the rose of the whole world, <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>
the herald of the spring <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>
decked in the proud livery of youth, <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a>
the lovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear, <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a>
and whose beauty was the very raiment of Shakespeare&rsquo;s heart,
<a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a> as it was the keystone
of his dramatic power?&nbsp; How bitter now seemed the whole tragedy
of his desertion and his shame! - shame that he made sweet and lovely
<a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9">{9}</a> by the mere magic
of his personality, but that was none the less shame.&nbsp; Yet as Shakespeare
forgave him, should not we forgive him also?&nbsp; I did not care to
pry into the mystery of his sin.</p>
<p>His abandonment of Shakespeare&rsquo;s theatre was a different matter,
and I investigated it at great length.&nbsp; Finally I came to the conclusion
that Cyril Graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of
the 80th Sonnet as Chapman.&nbsp; It was obviously Marlowe who was alluded
to.&nbsp; At the time the Sonnets were written, such an expression as
&lsquo;the proud full sail of his great verse&rsquo; could not have
been used of Chapman&rsquo;s work, however applicable it might have
been to the style of his later Jacobean plays.&nbsp; No: Marlowe was
clearly the rival dramatist of whom Shakespeare spoke in such laudatory
terms; and that</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Affable familiar ghost<br />Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>was the Mephistopheles of his <i>Doctor Faustus</i>.&nbsp; No doubt,
Marlowe was fascinated by the beauty and grace of the boy-actor, and
lured him away from the Blackfriars Theatre, that he might play the
Gaveston of his <i>Edward II</i>.&nbsp; That Shakespeare had the legal
right to retain Willie Hughes in his own company is evident from Sonnet
LXXXVII., where he says:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br />And like enough
thou know&rsquo;st thy estimate:<br />The <i>charter of thy worth</i>
gives thee releasing;<br />My <i>bonds</i> in thee are all determinate.<br />For
how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br />And for that riches where
is my deserving?<br />The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br /><i>And
so my patent back again is swerving.<br /></i>Thyself thou gayest, thy
own worth then not knowing,<br />Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else
mistaking;<br />So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br />Comes
home again, on better judgement making.<br />Thus have I had thee, as
a dream doth flatter,<br />In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>But him whom he could not hold by love, he would not hold by force.&nbsp;
Willie Hughes became a member of Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s company, and,
perhaps in the open yard of the Red Bull Tavern, played the part of
King Edward&rsquo;s delicate minion.&nbsp; On Marlowe&rsquo;s death,
he seems to have returned to Shakespeare, who, whatever his fellow-partners
may have thought of the matter, was not slow to forgive the wilfulness
and treachery of the young actor.</p>
<p>How well, too, had Shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stage-player!&nbsp;
Willie Hughes was one of those</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>That do not do the thing they most do show,<br />Who, moving others,
are themselves as stone.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>He could act love, but could not feel it, could mimic passion without
realising it.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In many&rsquo;s looks the false heart&rsquo;s history<br />Is writ
in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>but with Willie Hughes it was not so.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven,&rsquo;
says Shakespeare, in a sonnet of mad idolatry -</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Heaven in thy creation did decree<br />That in thy face sweet love
should ever dwell;<br />Whate&rsquo;er thy thoughts or thy heart&rsquo;s
workings be,<br />Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In his &lsquo;inconstant mind&rsquo; and his &lsquo;false heart,&rsquo;
it was easy to recognise the insincerity and treachery that somehow
seem inseparable from the artistic nature, as in his love of praise
that desire for immediate recognition that characterises all actors.&nbsp;
And yet, more fortunate in this than other actors, Willie Hughes was
to know something of immortality.&nbsp; Inseparably connected with Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays, he was to live in them.</p>
<p>Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<br />Though I, once
gone, to all the world must die:<br />The earth can yield me but a common
grave,<br />When you entombed in men&rsquo;s eyes shall lie.<br />Your
monument shall be my gentle verse,<br />Which eyes not yet created shall
o&rsquo;er-read,<br />And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,<br />When
all the breathers of this world are dead.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There were endless allusions, also, to Willie Hughes&rsquo;s power
over his audience - the &lsquo;gazers,&rsquo; as Shakespeare calls them;
but perhaps the most perfect description of his wonderful mastery over
dramatic art was in <i>A Lover&rsquo;s Complaint</i>, where Shakespeare
says of him:-</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>In him a plenitude of subtle matter,<br />Applied to cautels, all
strange forms receives,<br />Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,<br />Or
swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,<br />In either&rsquo;s aptness,
as it best deceives,<br />To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,<br />Or
to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.</p>
<p>* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>So on the tip of his subduing tongue,<br />All kind of arguments
and questions deep,<br />All replication prompt and reason strong,<br />For
his advantage still did wake and sleep,<br />To make the weeper laugh,
the laugher weep.<br />He had the dialect and the different skill,<br />Catching
all passions in his craft of will.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Once I thought that I had really found Willie Hughes in Elizabethan
literature.&nbsp; In a wonderfully graphic account of the last days
of the great Earl of Essex, his chaplain, Thomas Knell, tells us that
the night before the Earl died, &lsquo;he called William Hewes, which
was his musician, to play upon the virginals and to sing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Play,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;my song, Will Hewes, and I will sing it to myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So he did it most joyfully, not as the howling swan, which, still looking
down, waileth her end, but as a sweet lark, lifting up his hands and
casting up his eyes to his God, with this mounted the crystal skies,
and reached with his unwearied tongue the top of highest heavens.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Surely the boy who played on the virginals to the dying father of Sidney&rsquo;s
Stella was none other but the Will Hews to whom Shakespeare dedicated
the Sonnets, and who he tells us was himself sweet &lsquo;music to hear.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yet Lord Essex died in 1576, when Shakespeare himself was but twelve
years of age.&nbsp; It was impossible that his musician could have been
the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.&nbsp; Perhaps Shakespeare&rsquo;s young
friend was the son of the player upon the virginals?&nbsp; It was at
least something to have discovered that Will Hews was an Elizabethan
name.&nbsp; Indeed the name Hews seemed to have been closely connected
with music and the stage.&nbsp; The first English actress was the lovely
Margaret Hews, whom Prince Rupert so madly loved.&nbsp; What more probable
than that between her and Lord Essex&rsquo;s musician had come the boy-actor
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays?&nbsp; But the proofs, the links - where
were they?&nbsp; Alas! I could not find them.&nbsp; It seemed to me
that I was always on the brink of absolute verification, but that I
could never really attain to it.</p>
<p>From Willie Hughes&rsquo;s life I soon passed to thoughts of his
death.&nbsp; I used to wonder what had been his end.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had been one of those English actors who in 1604 went
across sea to Germany and played before the great Duke Henry Julius
of Brunswick, himself a dramatist of no mean order, and at the Court
of that strange Elector of Brandenburg, who was so enamoured of beauty
that he was said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son
of a travelling Greek merchant, and to have given pageants in honour
of his slave all through that dreadful famine year of 1606-7, when the
people died of hunger in the very streets of the town, and for the space
of seven months there was no rain.&nbsp; We know at any rate that <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> was brought out at Dresden in 1613, along with <i>Hamlet</i>
and <i>King Lear</i>, and it was surely to none other than Willie Hughes
that in 1615 the death-mask of Shakespeare was brought by the hand of
one of the suite of the English ambassador, pale token of the passing
away of the great poet who had so dearly loved him.&nbsp; Indeed there
would have been something peculiarly fitting in the idea that the boy-actor,
whose beauty had been so vital an element in the realism and romance
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s art, should have been the first to have brought
to Germany the seed of the new culture, and was in his way the precursor
of that <i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i> or Illumination of the eighteenth century,
that splendid movement which, though begun by Lessing and Herder, and
brought to its full and perfect issue by Goethe, was in no small part
helped on by another actor - Friedrich Schroeder - who awoke the popular
consciousness, and by means of the feigned passions and mimetic methods
of the stage showed the intimate, the vital, connection between life
and literature.&nbsp; If this was so - and there was certainly no evidence
against it - it was not improbable that Willie Hughes was one of those
English comedians (<i>mimae quidam ex Britannia</i>, as the old chronicle
calls them), who were slain at Nuremberg in a sudden uprising of the
people, and were secretly buried in a little vineyard outside the city
by some young men &lsquo;who had found pleasure in their performances,
and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the mysteries of the
new art.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly no more fitting place could there be
for him to whom Shakespeare said, &lsquo;thou art all my art,&rsquo;
than this little vineyard outside the city walls.&nbsp; For was it not
from the sorrows of Dionysos that Tragedy sprang?&nbsp; Was not the
light laughter of Comedy, with its careless merriment and quick replies,
first heard on the lips of the Sicilian vine-dressers?&nbsp; Nay, did
not the purple and red stain of the wine-froth on face and limbs give
the first suggestion of the charm and fascination of disguise - the
desire for self-concealment, the sense of the value of objectivity thus
showing itself in the rude beginnings of the art?&nbsp; At any rate,
wherever he lay - whether in the little vineyard at the gate of the
Gothic town, or in some dim London churchyard amidst the roar and bustle
of our great city - no gorgeous monument marked his resting-place.&nbsp;
His true tomb, as Shakespeare saw, was the poet&rsquo;s verse, his true
monument the permanence of the drama.&nbsp; So had it been with others
whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age.&nbsp; The
ivory body of the Bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the Nile,
and on the yellow hills of the Cerameicus is strewn the dust of the
young Athenian; but Antinous lives in sculpture, and Charmides in philosophy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>After three weeks had elapsed, I determined to make a strong appeal
to Erskine to do justice to the memory of Cyril Graham, and to give
to the world his marvellous interpretation of the Sonnets - the only
interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem.&nbsp; I have not
any copy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been able to lay
my hand upon the original; but I remember that I went over the whole
ground, and covered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the
arguments and proofs that my study had suggested to me.&nbsp; It seemed
to me that I was not merely restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place
in literary history, but rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself
from the tedious memory of a commonplace intrigue.&nbsp; I put into
the letter all my enthusiasm.&nbsp; I put into the letter all my faith.</p>
<p>No sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came
over me.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for
belief in the Willie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had
gone out of me, as it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to
the whole subject.&nbsp; What was it that had happened?&nbsp; It is
difficult to say.&nbsp; Perhaps, by finding perfect expression for a
passion, I had exhausted the passion itself.&nbsp; Emotional forces,
like the forces of physical life, have their positive limitations.&nbsp;
Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some
form of renunciation of the power of credence.&nbsp; Perhaps I was simply
tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having burnt out, my reason
was left to its own unimpassioned judgment.&nbsp; However it came about,
and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt that Willie Hughes
suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the boyish fancy of
a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more anxious to convince
others than to be himself convinced.</p>
<p>As I had said some very unjust and bitter things to Erskine in my
letter, I determined to go and see him at once, and to make my apologies
to him for my behaviour.&nbsp; Accordingly, the next morning I drove
down to Birdcage Walk, and found Erskine sitting in his library, with
the forged picture of Willie Hughes in front of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Erskine!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;I have come to apologise
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To apologise to me?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For my letter,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have nothing to regret in your letter,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;On the contrary, you have done me the greatest service in your
power.&nbsp; You have shown me that Cyril Graham&rsquo;s theory is perfectly
sound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you believe in Willie Hughes?&rsquo;
I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; he rejoined.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have proved
the thing to me.&nbsp; Do you think I cannot estimate the value of evidence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is no evidence at all,&rsquo; I groaned, sinking
into a chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I wrote to you I was under the influence
of a perfectly silly enthusiasm.&nbsp; I had been touched by the story
of Cyril Graham&rsquo;s death, fascinated by his romantic theory, enthralled
by the wonder and novelty of the whole idea.&nbsp; I see now that the
theory is based on a delusion.&nbsp; The only evidence for the existence
of Willie Hughes is that picture in front of you, and the picture is
a forgery.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be carried away by mere sentiment in this
matter.&nbsp; Whatever romance may have to say about the Willie Hughes
theory, reason is dead against it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rsquo; said Erskine, looking
at me in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you yourself have convinced me
by your letter that Willie Hughes is an absolute reality.&nbsp; Why
have you changed your mind?&nbsp; Or is all that you have been saying
to me merely a joke?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot explain it to you,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;but
I see now that there is really nothing to be said in favour of Cyril
Graham&rsquo;s interpretation.&nbsp; The Sonnets are addressed to Lord
Pembroke.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t waste your time
in a foolish attempt to discover a young Elizabethan actor who never
existed, and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the great cycle
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see that you don&rsquo;t understand the theory,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Erskine,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;not understand it!&nbsp;
Why, I feel as if I had invented it.&nbsp; Surely my letter shows you
that I not merely went into the whole matter, but that I contributed
proofs of every kind.&nbsp; The one flaw in the theory is that it presupposes
the existence of the person whose existence is the subject of dispute.&nbsp;
If we grant that there was in Shakespeare&rsquo;s company a young actor
of the name of Willie Hughes, it is not difficult to make him the object
of the Sonnets.&nbsp; But as we know that there was no actor of this
name in the company of the Globe Theatre, it is idle to pursue the investigation
further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that is exactly what we don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said
Erskine.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is quite true that his name does not occur
in the list given in the first folio; but, as Cyril pointed out, that
is rather a proof in favour of the existence of Willie Hughes than against
it, if we remember his treacherous desertion of Shakespeare for a rival
dramatist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We argued the matter over for hours, but nothing that I could say
could make Erskine surrender his faith in Cyril Graham&rsquo;s interpretation.&nbsp;
He told me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory,
and that he was determined to do justice to Cyril Graham&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp;
I entreated him, laughed at him, begged of him, but it was of no use.&nbsp;
Finally we parted, not exactly in anger, but certainly with a shadow
between us.&nbsp; He thought me shallow, I thought him foolish.&nbsp;
When I called on him again his servant told me that he had gone to Germany.</p>
<p>Two years afterwards, as I was going into my club, the hall-porter
handed me a letter with a foreign postmark.&nbsp; It was from Erskine,
and written at the H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Angleterre, Cannes.&nbsp; When
I had read it I was filled with horror, though I did not quite believe
that he would be so mad as to carry his resolve into execution.&nbsp;
The gist of the letter was that he had tried in every way to verify
the Willie Hughes theory, and had failed, and that as Cyril Graham had
given his life for this theory, he himself had determined to give his
own life also to the same cause.&nbsp; The concluding words of the letter
were these: &lsquo;I still believe in Willie Hughes; and by the time
you receive this, I shall have died by my own hand for Willie Hughes&rsquo;s
sake: for his sake, and for the sake of Cyril Graham, whom I drove to
his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant lack of faith.&nbsp;
The truth was once revealed to you, and you rejected it.&nbsp; It comes
to you now stained with the blood of two lives, - do not turn away from
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a horrible moment.&nbsp; I felt sick with misery, and yet
I could not believe it.&nbsp; To die for one&rsquo;s theological beliefs
is the worst use a man can make of his life, but to die for a literary
theory!&nbsp; It seemed impossible.</p>
<p>I looked at the date.&nbsp; The letter was a week old.&nbsp; Some
unfortunate chance had prevented my going to the club for several days,
or I might have got it in time to save him.&nbsp; Perhaps it was not
too late.&nbsp; I drove off to my rooms, packed up my things, and started
by the night-mail from Charing Cross.&nbsp; The journey was intolerable.&nbsp;
I thought I would never arrive.&nbsp; As soon as I did I drove to the
H&ocirc;tel l&rsquo;Angleterre.&nbsp; They told me that Erskine had
been buried two days before in the English cemetery.&nbsp; There was
something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy.&nbsp; I said all
kinds of wild things, and the people in the hall looked curiously at
me.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed across the vestibule.&nbsp;
When she saw me she came up to me, murmured something about her poor
son, and burst into tears.&nbsp; I led her into her sitting-room.&nbsp;
An elderly gentleman was there waiting for her.&nbsp; It was the English
doctor.</p>
<p>We talked a great deal about Erskine, but I said nothing about his
motive for committing suicide.&nbsp; It was evident that he had not
told his mother anything about the reason that had driven him to so
fatal, so mad an act.&nbsp; Finally Lady Erskine rose and said, George
left you something as a memento.&nbsp; It was a thing he prized very
much.&nbsp; I will get it for you.</p>
<p>As soon as she had left the room I turned to the doctor and said,
&lsquo;What a dreadful shock it must have been to Lady Erskine!&nbsp;
I wonder that she bears it as well as she does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she knew for months past that it was coming,&rsquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knew it for months past!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
why didn&rsquo;t she stop him?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t she have him watched?&nbsp;
He must have been mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The doctor stared at me. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;if a mother knows that her son
is going to commit suicide - &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suicide!&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Erskine did
not commit suicide.&nbsp; He died of consumption.&nbsp; He came here
to die.&nbsp; The moment I saw him I knew that there was no hope.&nbsp;
One lung was almost gone, and the other was very much affected.&nbsp;
Three days before he died he asked me was there any hope.&nbsp; I told
him frankly that there was none, and that he had only a few days to
live.&nbsp; He wrote some letters, and was quite resigned, retaining
his senses to the last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Lady Erskine entered the room with the fatal picture
of Willie Hughes in her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;When George was dying he
begged me to give you this,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; As I took it from
her, her tears fell on my hand.</p>
<p>The picture hangs now in my library, where it is very much admired
by my artistic friends.&nbsp; They have decided that it is not a Clouet,
but an Oudry.&nbsp; I have never cared to tell them its true history.&nbsp;
But sometimes, when I look at it, I think that there is really a great
deal to be said for the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Sonnets.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
