<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When the learned first gave serious attention to popular ballads,
from the time of Percy to that of Scott, they laboured under certain
disabilities.&nbsp; The Comparative Method was scarcely understood,
and was little practised.&nbsp; Editors were content to study the ballads
of their own countryside, or, at most, of Great Britain.&nbsp; Teutonic
and Northern parallels to our ballads were then adduced, as by Scott
and Jamieson.&nbsp; It was later that the ballads of Europe, from the
Faroes to Modern Greece, were compared with our own, with European <i>M&auml;rchen</i>,
or children&rsquo;s tales, and with the popular songs, dances, and traditions
of classical and savage peoples.&nbsp; The results of this more recent
comparison may be briefly stated.&nbsp; Poetry begins, as Aristotle
says, in improvisation.&nbsp; Every man is his own poet, and, in moments
of stronge motion, expresses himself in song.&nbsp; A typical example
is the Song of Lamech in Genesis&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have slain a man to my wounding,<br />And a young man to
my hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Instances perpetually occur in the Sagas: Grettir, Egil, Skarphedin,
are always singing.&nbsp; In <i>Kidnapped</i>, Mr. Stevenson introduces
&ldquo;The Song of the Sword of Alan,&rdquo; a fine example of Celtic
practice: words and air are beaten out together, in the heat of victory.&nbsp;
In the same way, the women sang improvised dirges, like Helen; lullabies,
like the lullaby of Danae in Simonides, and flower songs, as in modern
Italy.&nbsp; Every function of life, war, agriculture, the chase, had
its appropriate magical and mimetic dance and song, as in Finland, among
Red Indians, and among Australian blacks.&nbsp; &ldquo;The deeds of
men&rdquo; were chanted by heroes, as by Achilles; stories were told
in alternate verse and prose; girls, like Homer&rsquo;s Nausicaa, accompanied
dance and ball play, priests and medicine-men accompanied rites and
magical ceremonies by songs.</p>
<p>These practices are world-wide, and world-old.&nbsp; The thoroughly
popular songs, thus evolved, became the rude material of a professional
class of minstrels, when these arose, as in the heroic age of Greece.&nbsp;
A minstrel might be attached to a Court, or a noble; or he might go
wandering with song and harp among the people.&nbsp; In either case,
this class of men developed more regular and ample measures.&nbsp; They
evolved the hexameter; the <i>laisse</i> of the <i>Chansons de Geste</i>;
the strange technicalities of Scandinavian poetry; the metres of Vedic
hymns; the choral odes of Greece.&nbsp; The narrative popular chant
became in their hands the Epic, or the mediaeval rhymed romance.&nbsp;
The metre of improvised verse changed into the artistic lyric.&nbsp;
These lyric forms were fixed, in many cases, by the art of writing.&nbsp;
But poetry did not remain solely in professional and literary hands.&nbsp;
The mediaeval minstrels and <i>jongleurs</i> (who may best be studied
in L&eacute;on Gautier&rsquo;s Introduction to his <i>Epop&eacute;es</i>
<i>Fran&ccedil;aises</i>) sang in Court and Camp.&nbsp; The poorer,
less regular brethren of the art, harped and played conjuring tricks,
in farm and grange, or at street corners.&nbsp; The foreign newer metres
took the place of the old alliterative English verse.&nbsp; But unprofessional
men and women did not cease to make and sing.</p>
<p>Some writers have decided, among them Mr. Courthope, that our traditional
ballads are degraded popular survivals of literary poetry.&nbsp; The
plots and situations of some ballads are, indeed, the same as those
of some literary mediaeval romances.&nbsp; But these plots and situations,
in Epic and Romance, are themselves the final literary form of <i>m&auml;rchen</i>,
myths and inventions originally <i>popular</i>, and still, in certain
cases, extant in popular form among races which have not yet evolved,
or borrowed, the ampler and more polished and complex <i>genres</i>
of literature.&nbsp; Thus, when a literary romance and a ballad have
the same theme, the ballad may be a popular degradation of the romance;
or, it may be the original popular shape of it, still surviving in tradition.&nbsp;
A well-known case in prose, is that of the French fairy tales.</p>
<p>Perrault, in 1697, borrowed these from tradition and gave them literary
and courtly shape.&nbsp; But <i>Cendrillon</i> or <i>Chaperon Rouge</i>
in the mouth of a French peasant, is apt to be the old traditional version,
uncontaminated by the refinements of Perrault, despite Perrault&rsquo;s
immense success and circulation.&nbsp; Thus tradition preserves pre-literary
forms, even though, on occasion, it may borrow from literature.&nbsp;
Peasant poets have been authors of ballads, without being, for all that,
professional minstrels.&nbsp; Many such poems survive in our ballad
literature.</p>
<p>The material of the ballad may be either romantic or historical.&nbsp;
The former class is based on one of the primeval invented situations,
one of the elements of the <i>M&auml;rchen</i> in prose.&nbsp; Such
tales or myths occur in the stories of savages, in the legends of peasants,
are interwoven later with the plot in Epic or Romance, and may also
inspire ballads.&nbsp; Popular superstitions, the witch, metamorphosis,
the returning ghost, the fairy, all of them survivals of the earliest
thought, naturally play a great part.&nbsp; The Historical ballad, on
the other hand, has a basis of resounding fact, murder, battle, or fire-raising,
but the facts, being derived from popular rumour, are immediately corrupted
and distorted, sometimes out of all knowledge.&nbsp; Good examples are
the ballads on Darnley&rsquo;s murder and the youth of James VI.</p>
<p>In the romantic class, we may take <i>Tamlane</i>.&nbsp; Here the
idea of fairies stealing children is thoroughly popular; they also steal
young men as lovers, and again, men may win fairy brides, by clinging
to them through all transformations.&nbsp; A classical example is the
seizure of Thetis by Peleus, and Child quotes a modern Cretan example.&nbsp;
The dipping in milk and water, I may add, has precedent in ancient Egypt
(in <i>The Two Brothers</i>), and in modern Senegambia.&nbsp; The fairy
tax, tithe, or teind, paid to Hell, is illustrated by old trials for
witchcraft, in Scotland. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>&nbsp;
Now, in literary forms and romance, as in <i>Ogier le Danois</i>, persons
are carried away by the Fairy King or Queen.&nbsp; But here the literary
romance borrows from popular superstition; the ballad has no need to
borrow a familiar fact from literary romance.&nbsp; On the whole subject
the curious may consult &ldquo;The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns,
and Fairies,&rdquo; by the Reverend Robert Kirk of Aberfoyle, himself,
according to tradition, a victim of the fairies.</p>
<p>Thus, in <i>Tamlane</i>, the whole <i>donn&eacute;e</i> is popular.&nbsp;
But the current version, that of Scott, is contaminated, as Scott knew,
by incongruous modernisms.&nbsp; Burns&rsquo;s version, from tradition,
already localizes the events at Carterhaugh, the junction of Ettrick
and Yarrow.&nbsp; But Burns&rsquo;s version does not make the Earl of
Murray father of the hero, nor the Earl of March father of the heroine.&nbsp;
Roxburgh is the hero&rsquo;s father in Burns&rsquo;s variant, which
is more plausible, and the modern verses do not occur.&nbsp; This ballad
apparently owes nothing to literary romance.</p>
<p>In <i>Mary Hamilton</i> we have a notable instance of the Historical
Ballad.&nbsp; No Marie of Mary Stuart&rsquo;s suffered death for child
murder.</p>
<p>She had no Marie Hamilton, no Marie Carmichael among her four Maries,
though a lady of the latter name was at her court.&nbsp; But early in
the reign a Frenchwoman of the queen&rsquo;s was hanged, with her paramour,
an apothecary, for slaying her infant.&nbsp; Knox mentions the fact,
which is also recorded in letters from the English ambassador, uncited
by Mr. Child.&nbsp; Knox adds that there were ballads against the Maries.&nbsp;
Now, in March 1719, a Mary Hamilton, of Scots descent, a maid of honour
of Catherine of Russia, was hanged for child murder (<i>Child</i>, vi.
383).&nbsp; It has therefore been supposed, first by Charles Kirkpatrick
Sharpe long ago, later by Professor Child, and then by Mr. Courthope,
that our ballad is of 1719, or later, and deals with the Russian, not
the Scotch, tragedy.</p>
<p>To this we may reply (1) that we have no example of such a throwing
back of a contemporary event, in ballads.&nbsp; (2) There is a version
(<i>Child</i>, viii. 507) in which Mary Hamilton&rsquo;s paramour is
a &ldquo;pottinger,&rdquo; or apothecary, as in the real old Scotch
affair.&nbsp; (3) The number of variants of a ballad is likely to be
proportionate to its antiquity and wide distribution.&nbsp; Now only
<i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> has so many widely different variants as <i>Mary
Hamilton</i>.&nbsp; These could hardly have been evolved between 1719
and 1790, when Burns quotes the poem as an old ballad.&nbsp; (4) We
have no example of a poem so much in the old ballad manner, for perhaps
a hundred and fifty years before 1719.&nbsp; The style first degraded
and then expired: compare <i>Rob Roy</i> and <i>Killiecrankie</i>, in
this collection, also the ballads of <i>Loudoun Hill</i>,<i> The Battle
of Philiphaugh</i>, and others much earlier than 1719.&nbsp; New styles
of popular poetry on contemporary events as <i>Sherriffmuir</i> and
<i>Tranent Brae</i> had arisen.&nbsp; (5) The extreme historic inaccuracy
of <i>Mary Hamilton</i> is paralleled by that of all the ballads on
real events.&nbsp; The mention of the Pottinger is a trace of real history
which has no parallel in the Russian affair, and there is no room, says
Professor Child, for the supposition that it was voluntarily inserted
by reciter or copyist, to tally with the narrative in Knox&rsquo;s History.</p>
<p>On the other side, we have the name of Mary Hamilton occurring in
a tragic event of 1719, but then the name does not uniformly appear
in the variants of the ballad.&nbsp; The lady is there spoken of generally
as Mary Hamilton, but also as Mary Myle, Lady Maisry, as daughter of
the Duke of York (Stuart), as Marie Mild, and so forth.&nbsp; Though
she bids sailors carry the tale of her doom, she is not abroad, but
in Edinburgh town.&nbsp; Nothing can be less probable than that a Scots
popular ballad-maker in 1719, telling the tale of a yesterday&rsquo;s
tragedy in Russia, should throw the time back by a hundred and fifty
years, should change the scene to Scotland (the heart of the sorrow
would be Mary&rsquo;s exile), and, above all, should compose a ballad
in a style long obsolete.&nbsp; This is not the method of the popular
poet, and such imitations of the old ballad as <i>Hardyknute</i> show
that literary poets of 1719 had not knowledge or skill enough to mimic
the antique manner with any success.</p>
<p>We may, therefore, even in face of Professor Child, regard <i>Mary
Hamilton</i> as an old example of popular perversion of history in ballad,
not as &ldquo;one of the very latest,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;one of
the very best&rdquo; of Scottish popular ballads.</p>
<p><i>Rob Roy</i> shows the same power of perversion.&nbsp; It was not
Rob Roy but his sons, Robin Oig (who shot Maclaren at the plough-tail),
and James Mohr (alternately the spy, the Jacobite, and the Hanoverian
spy once more), who carried off the heiress of Edenbelly.&nbsp; Indeed
a kind of added epilogue, in a different measure, proves that a poet
was aware of the facts, and wished to correct his predecessor.</p>
<p>Such then are ballads, in relation to legend and history.&nbsp; They
are, on the whole, with exceptions, absolutely popular in origin, composed
by men of the people for the people, and then diffused among and altered
by popular reciters.&nbsp; In England they soon won their way into printed
stall copies, and were grievously handled and moralized by the hack
editors.</p>
<p>No ballad has a stranger history than <i>The Loving Ballad of Lord
Bateman</i>, illustrated by the pencils of Cruikshank and Thackeray.&nbsp;
Their form is a ludicrous cockney perversion, but it retains the essence.&nbsp;
Bateman, a captive of &ldquo;this Turk,&rdquo; is beloved by the Turk&rsquo;s
daughter (a staple incident of old French romance), and by her released.&nbsp;
The lady after seven years rejoins Lord Bateman: he has just married
a local bride, but &ldquo;orders another marriage,&rdquo; and sends
home his bride &ldquo;in a coach and three.&rdquo;&nbsp; This incident
is stereotyped in the ballads and occurs in an example in the Romaic.
<a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a></p>
<p>Now Lord Bateman is <i>Young Bekie</i> in the Scotch ballads, who
becomes <i>Young Beichan</i>,<i> Young Bichem</i>, and so forth, and
has adventures identical with those of Lord Bateman, though the proud
porter in the Scots version is scarcely so prominent and illustrious.&nbsp;
As Motherwell saw, Bekie (Beichan, Buchan, Bateman) is really Becket,
Gilbert Becket, father of Thomas of Canterbury.&nbsp; Every one has
heard how <i>his</i> Saracen bride sought him in London.&nbsp; (Robert
of Gloucester&rsquo;s <i>Life and Martyrdom of Thomas Becket</i>, Percy
Society.&nbsp; See Child&rsquo;s Introduction, IV., i. 1861, and <i>Motherwell&rsquo;s
Minstrelsy</i>, p. xv., 1827.)&nbsp; The legend of the dissolved marriage
is from the common stock of ballad lore, Motherwell found an example
in the state of <i>Cantefable</i>, alternate prose and verse, like <i>Aucassin
and Nicolette</i>.&nbsp; Thus the cockney rhyme descends from the twelfth
century.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the curiosities of the ballad.&nbsp; The examples
selected are chiefly chosen for their romantic charm, and for the spirit
of the Border raids which they record.&nbsp; A few notes are added in
an appendix.&nbsp; The text is chosen from among the many variants in
Child&rsquo;s learned but still unfinished collection, and an effort
has been made to choose the copies which contain most poetry with most
signs of uncontaminated originality.&nbsp; In a few cases Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s versions, though confessedly &ldquo;made up,&rdquo; are
preferred.&nbsp; Perhaps the editor may be allowed to say that he does
not merely plough with Professor Child&rsquo;s heifer, but has made
a study of ballads from his boyhood.</p>
<p>This fact may exempt him, even in the eyes of too patriotic American
critics, from &ldquo;the common blame of a plagiary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed,
as Professor Child has not yet published his general theory of the Ballad,
the editor does not know whether he agrees with the ideas here set forth.</p>
<p>So far the Editor had written, when news came of Professor Child&rsquo;s
regretted death.&nbsp; He had lived to finish, it is said, the vast
collection of all known traditional Scottish and English Ballads, with
all accessible variants, a work of great labour and research, and a
distinguished honour to American scholarship.&nbsp; We are not told,
however, that he had written a general study of the topic, with his
conclusions as to the evolution and diffusion of the Ballads: as to
the influences which directed the selection of certain themes of <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
for poetic treatment, and the processes by which identical ballads were
distributed throughout Europe.&nbsp; No one, it is to be feared, is
left, in Europe at least, whose knowledge of the subject is so wide
and scientific as that of Professor Child.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that
some pupil of his may complete the task in his sense, if, indeed, he
has left it unfinished.</p>

<h2>Ballad: Sir Patrick Spens</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Border Minstrelsy.)</p>
<p>The king sits in Dunfermline town,<br />Drinking the blude-red wine
o:<br />&ldquo;O whare will I get a skeely skipper<br />To sail this
new ship of mine o?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O up and spake an eldern-knight,<br />Sat at the king&rsquo;s right
knee:<br />&ldquo;Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailor<br />That ever
saild the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our king has written a braid letter,<br />And seald it with his hand,<br />And
sent it to Sir Patrick Spens,<br />Was walking on the strand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Noroway, to Noroway,<br />To Noroway oer the faem;<br />The
king&rsquo;s daughter of Noroway,<br />&rsquo;Tis thou maun bring her
hame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first word that Sir Patrick read,<br />Sae loud, loud laughed
he;<br />The neist word that Sir Patrick read,<br />The tear blinded
his ee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O wha is this has done this deed,<br />And tauld the king
o me,<br />To send us out, at this time of the year,<br />To sail upon
the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it wind, be it weet, be it hall, be it sleet,<br />Our
ship must sail the faem;<br />The king&rsquo;s daughter of Noroway,<br />&rsquo;Tis
we must fetch her hame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hoysed their sails on Monenday morn,<br />Wi&rsquo; a&rsquo;
the speed they may;<br />They hae landed in Noroway,<br />Upon a Wodensday.</p>
<p>They hadna been a week, a week<br />In Noroway but twae,<br />When
that the lords o Noroway<br />Began aloud to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Scottishmen spend a&rsquo; our king&rsquo;s goud,<br />And
a&rsquo; our queenis fee.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Ye lie, ye lie, ye liars
loud!<br />Fu&rsquo; loud I hear ye lie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I brought as much white monie<br />As gane my men and
me,<br />And I brought a half-fou&rsquo; o&rsquo; gude red goud,<br />Out
o&rsquo;er the sea wi&rsquo; me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make ready, make ready, my merry-men a&rsquo;!<br />Our gude
ship sails the morn.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Now ever alake, my master dear,<br />I
fear a deadly storm!</p>
<p>I saw the new moon, late yestreen,<br />Wi&rsquo; the auld moon in
her arm;<br />And if we gang to sea, master,<br />I fear we&rsquo;ll
come to harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hadna sail&rsquo;d a league, a league,<br />A league but barely
three,<br />When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud,<br />And
gurly grew the sea.</p>
<p>The ankers brak, and the top-masts lap,<br />It was sic a deadly
storm;<br />And the waves cam o&rsquo;er the broken ship,<br />Till
a&rsquo; her sides were torn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O where will I get a gude sailor,<br />To take my helm in
hand,<br />Till I get up to the tall top-mast;<br />To see if I can
spy land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O here am I, a sailor gude,<br />To take the helm in hand,<br />Till
you go up to the tall top-mast<br />But I fear you&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er
spy land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hadna gane a step, a step,<br />A step but barely ane,<br />When
a bout flew out of our goodly ship,<br />And the salt sea it came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gae, fetch a web o&rsquo; the silken claith,<br />Another
o&rsquo; the twine,<br />And wap them into our ship&rsquo;s side,<br />And
let na the sea come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fetchd a web o the silken claith,<br />Another o the twine,<br />And
they wapped them roun that gude ship&rsquo;s side<br />But still the
sea came in.</p>
<p>O laith, laith, were our gude Scots lords<br />To weet their cork-heel&rsquo;d
shoon!<br />But lang or a the play was play&rsquo;d<br />They wat their
hats aboon,</p>
<p>And mony was the feather-bed<br />That fluttered on the faem,<br />And
mony was the gude lord&rsquo;s son<br />That never mair cam hame.</p>
<p>The ladyes wrang their fingers white,<br />The maidens tore their
hair,<br />A&rsquo; for the sake of their true loves,<br />For them
they&rsquo;ll see na mair.</p>
<p>O lang, lang may the ladyes sit,<br />Wi&rsquo; their fans into their
hand,<br />Before they see Sir Patrick Spens<br />Come sailing to the
strand!</p>
<p>And lang, lang may the maidens sit,<br />Wi&rsquo; their goud kaims
in their hair,<br />A&rsquo; waiting for their ain dear loves!<br />For
them they&rsquo;ll see na mair.</p>
<p>O forty miles off Aberdeen,<br />&rsquo;Tis fifty fathoms deep,<br />And
there lies gude Sir Patrick Spens,<br />Wi&rsquo; the Scots lords at
his feet.</p>

<h2>Ballad: Battle Of Otterbourne</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Child, vol. vi.)</p>
<p>It fell about the Lammas tide,<br />When the muir-men win their hay,<br />The
doughty Douglas bound him to ride<br />Into England, to drive a prey.</p>
<p>He chose the Gordons and the Graemes,<br />With them the Lindesays,
light and gay;<br />But the Jardines wald nor with him ride,<br />And
they rue it to this day.</p>
<p>And he has burn&rsquo;d the dales of Tyne,<br />And part of Bambrough
shire:<br />And three good towers on Reidswire fells,<br />He left them
all on fire.</p>
<p>And he march&rsquo;d up to Newcastle,<br />And rode it round about:<br />&ldquo;O
wha&rsquo;s the lord of this castle?<br />Or wha&rsquo;s the lady o&rsquo;t
?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But up spake proud Lord Percy then,<br />And O but he spake hie!<br />&ldquo;I
am the lord of this castle,<br />My wife&rsquo;s the lady gaye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou&rsquo;rt the lord of this castle,<br />Sae weel it
pleases me!<br />For, ere I cross the Border fells,<br />The tane of
us sall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a lang spear in his hand,<br />Shod with the metal free,<br />And
for to meet the Douglas there,<br />He rode right furiouslie.</p>
<p>But O how pale his lady look&rsquo;d,<br />Frae aff the castle wa&rsquo;,<br />When
down, before the Scottish spear,<br />She saw proud Percy fa&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we twa been upon the green,<br />And never an eye to see,<br />I
wad hae had you, flesh and fell;<br />But your sword sall gae wi&rsquo;
mee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But gae ye up to Otterbourne,<br />And wait there dayis three;<br />And,
if I come not ere three dayis end,<br />A fause knight ca&rsquo; ye
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Otterbourne&rsquo;s a bonnie burn;<br />&rsquo;Tis pleasant
there to be;<br />But there is nought at Otterbourne,<br />To feed my
men and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deer rins wild on hill and dale,<br />The birds fly wild
from tree to tree;<br />But there is neither bread nor kale,<br />To
feed my men and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I will stay it Otterbourne,<br />Where you shall welcome
be;<br />And, if ye come not at three dayis end,<br />A fause lord I&rsquo;ll
ca&rsquo; thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thither will I come,&rdquo; proud Percy said,<br />&ldquo;By
the might of Our Ladye!&rdquo;&mdash;<br />&ldquo;There will I bide
thee,&rdquo; said the Douglas,<br />&ldquo;My troth I plight to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lighted high on Otterbourne,<br />Upon the bent sae brown;<br />They
lighted high on Otterbourne,<br />And threw their pallions down.</p>
<p>And he that had a bonnie boy,<br />Sent out his horse to grass,<br />And
he that had not a bonnie boy,<br />His ain servant he was.</p>
<p>But up then spake a little page,<br />Before the peep of dawn:<br />&ldquo;O
waken ye, waken ye, my good lord,<br />For Percy&rsquo;s hard at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye lie, ye lie, ye liar loud!<br />Sae loud I hear ye lie;<br />For
Percy had not men yestreen,<br />To dight my men and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have dream&rsquo;d a dreary dream,<br />Beyond the Isle
of Sky;<br />I saw a dead man win a fight,<br />And I think that man
was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He belted on his guid braid sword,<br />And to the field he ran;<br />But
he forgot the helmet good,<br />That should have kept his brain.</p>
<p>When Percy wi the Douglas met,<br />I wat he was fu fain!<br />They
swakked their swords, till sair they swat,<br />And the blood ran down
like rain.</p>
<p>But Percy with his good broad sword,<br />That could so sharply wound,<br />Has
wounded Douglas on the brow,<br />Till he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Then he calld on his little foot-page,<br />And said&mdash;&ldquo;Run
speedilie,<br />And fetch my ain dear sister&rsquo;s son,<br />Sir Hugh
Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew good,&rdquo; the Douglas said,<br />&ldquo;What
recks the death of ane!<br />Last night I dreamd a dreary dream,<br />And
I ken the day&rsquo;s thy ain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wound is deep; I fain would sleep;<br />Take thou the vanguard
of the three,<br />And hide me by the braken bush,<br />That grows on
yonder lilye lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O bury me by the braken-bush,<br />Beneath the blooming brier;<br />Let
never living mortal ken<br />That ere a kindly Scot lies here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted up that noble lord,<br />Wi the saut tear in his e&rsquo;e;<br />He
hid him in the braken bush,<br />That his merrie men might not see.</p>
<p>The moon was clear, the day drew near,<br />The spears in flinders
flew,<br />But mony a gallant Englishman<br />Ere day the Scotsmen slew.</p>
<p>The Gordons good, in English blood,<br />They steepd their hose and
shoon;<br />The Lindesays flew like fire about,<br />Till all the fray
was done.</p>
<p>The Percy and Montgomery met,<br />That either of other were fain;<br />They
swapped swords, and they twa swat,<br />And aye the blood ran down between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yield thee, now yield thee, Percy,&rdquo; he said,<br />&ldquo;Or
else I vow I&rsquo;ll lay thee low!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;To whom must
I yield,&rdquo; quoth Earl Percy,<br />&ldquo;Now that I see it must
be so ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not yield to lord nor loun,<br />Nor yet shalt
thou yield to me;<br />But yield thee to the braken-bush,<br />That
grows upon yon lilye lee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not yield to a braken-bush,<br />Nor yet will I yield
to a brier;<br />But I would yield to Earl Douglas,<br />Or Sir Hugh
the Montgomery, if he were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he knew it was Montgomery,<br />He stuck his sword&rsquo;s
point in the gronde;<br />The Montgomery was a courteous knight,<br />And
quickly took him by the honde.</p>
<p>This deed was done at Otterbourne,<br />About the breaking of the
day;<br />Earl Douglas was buried at the braken bush,<br />And the Percy
led captive away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ance it fell upon a day,<br />A cauld day and a snell,<br />When
we were frae the hunting come,<br />That frae my horse I fell;<br />The
Queen o Fairies she caught me,<br />In yon green hill to dwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pleasant is the fairy land,<br />But, an eerie tale to
tell,<br />Ay at the end of seven years<br />We pay a tiend to hell;<br />I
am sae fair and fu&rsquo; o flesh<br />I&rsquo;m feared it be mysel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the night is Halloween, lady,<br />The morn is Hallowday;<br />Then
win me, win me, an ye will,<br />For weel I wat ye may.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at the mirk and midnight hour<br />The fairy folk will
ride,<br />And they that wad their true love win,<br />At Miles Cross
they maun bide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall I thee ken, Tam Lin,<br />Or how my true-love
know,<br />Amang sae mony unco knights<br />The like I never saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O first let pass the black, lady,<br />And syne let pass the
brown,<br />But quickly run to the milk-white steed,<br />Pu ye his
rider down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My right hand will be gloyd, lady,<br />My left hand will
be bare,<br />Cockt up shall my bonnet be,<br />And kaimd down shall

I will be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll turn me in your arms, lady,<br />Into an esk

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll turn me to a bear sae grim,<br />And then a

love your child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again they&rsquo;ll turn me in your arms<br />To a red het

do to you nae harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last they&rsquo;ll turn me in your arms<br />Into the

<p>&ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll be your ain true-love,<br />I&rsquo;ll

<p>Gloomy, gloomy was the night,<br />And eerie was the way,<br />As
fair Jenny in her green mantle<br />To Miles Cross she did gae.</p>
<p>About the middle o&rsquo; the night<br />She heard the bridles ring;<br />This
lady was as glad at that<br />As any earthly thing.</p>
<p>First she let the black pass by,<br />And syne she let the brown;<br />But
quickly she ran to the milk-white steed,<br />And pu&rsquo;d the rider

<p>Sae weel she minded whae he did say,<br />And young Tam Lin did win;<br />Syne
coverd him wi her green mantle,<br />As blythe&rsquo;s a bird in spring.</p>
<p>Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,<br />Out of a bush o broom:<br />&ldquo;Them

<p>Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,<br />And an angry woman was she;<br />&ldquo;Shame

<p>True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank;<br />A ferlie he spied wi&rsquo;
his ee;<br />And there he saw a lady bright,<br />Come riding down by
the Eildon Tree.</p>
<p>Her skirt was o the grass-green silk,<br />Her mantle o the velvet
fyne,<br />At ilka tett of her horse&rsquo;s mane<br />Hang fifty siller
bells and nine.</p>
<p>True Thomas he pulld aff his cap,<br />And louted low down to his
knee:<br />&ldquo;All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven!<br />For thy
peer on earth I never did see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, O no, Thomas,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;That name
does not belang to me;<br />I am but the queen of fair Elfland,<br />That
am hither come to visit thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harp and carp, Thomas,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;Harp and

of your bodie I will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betide me weal, betide me woe,<br />That weird sall never

<p>&ldquo;Now, ye maun go wi me,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;True Thomas,
ye maun go wi me,<br />And ye maun serve me seven years,<br />Thro weal
or woe as may chance to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She mounted on her milk-white steed,<br />She&rsquo;s taen True Thomas
up behind,<br />And aye wheneer her bride rung,<br />The steed flew
swifter than the wind.</p>
<p>O they rade on, and farther on&mdash;<br />The steed gaed swifter
than the wind&mdash;<br />Until they reached a desart wide,<br />And
living land was left behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light down, light down, now, True Thomas,<br />And lean your

shew you ferlies three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O see ye not yon narrow road,<br />So thick beset with thorns
and briers?<br />That is the path of righteousness,<br />Tho after it
but few enquires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see ye not that braid braid road,<br />That lies across
that lily leven?<br />That is the path of wickedness,<br />Tho some
call it the road to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see not ye that bonny road,<br />That winds about the
fernie brae?<br />That is the road to fair Elfland,<br />Where thou
and I this night maun gae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue,<br />Whatever ye may
hear or see,<br />For, if you speak word in Elflyn land,<br />Ye&rsquo;ll
neer get back to your ain countrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O they rade on, and farther on,<br />And they waded thro rivers aboon
the knee,<br />And they saw neither sun nor moon,<br />But they heard
the roaring of the sea.</p>
<p>It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern light,<br />And they
waded thro red blude to the knee;<br />For a&rsquo; the blude that&rsquo;s
shed an earth<br />Rins thro the springs o that countrie.</p>
<p>Syne they came on to a garden green,<br />And she pu&rsquo;d an apple
frae a tree:<br />&ldquo;Take this for thy wages, True Thomas,<br />It
will give the tongue that can never lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tongue is mine ain,&rdquo; True Thomas said,<br />&ldquo;A

<h2>Ballad: Clerk Saunders</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Child, vol. iii.)</p>
<p>Clerk Saunders and may Margaret<br />Walked ower yon garden green;<br />And
sad and heavy was the love<br />That fell thir twa between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bed, a bed,&rdquo; Clerk Saunders said,<br />&ldquo;A bed
for you and me!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Fye na, fye na,&rdquo; said may Margaret,<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Till
anes we married be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For in may come my seven bauld brothers,<br />Wi&rsquo; torches
burning bright;<br />They&rsquo;ll say,&mdash;&lsquo;We hae but ae sister,<br />And
behold she&rsquo;s wi a knight!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take the sword frae my scabbard,<br />And slowly lift
the pin;<br />And you may swear, and save your aith.<br />Ye never let
Clerk Saunders in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And take a napkin in your hand,<br />And tie up baith your
bonny e&rsquo;en,<br />And you may swear, and save your aith,<br />Ye
saw me na since late yestreen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about the midnight hour,<br />When they asleep were laid,<br />When
in and came her seven brothers,<br />Wi&rsquo; torches burning red.</p>
<p>When in and came her seven brothers,<br />Wi&rsquo; torches burning
bright:<br />They said, &ldquo;We hae but ae sister,<br />And behold
her lying with a knight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out and spake the first o&rsquo; them,<br />&ldquo;I bear the
sword shall gar him die!&rdquo;<br />And out and spake the second o&rsquo;
them,<br />&ldquo;His father has nae mair than he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And out and spake the third o&rsquo; them,<br />&ldquo;I wot that
they are lovers dear!&rdquo;<br />And out and spake the fourth o&rsquo;
them,<br />&ldquo;They hae been in love this mony a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out and spake the fifth o&rsquo; them,<br />&ldquo;It were great
sin true love to twain!&rdquo;<br />And out and spake the sixth o&rsquo;
them,<br />&ldquo;It were shame to slay a sleeping man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and gat the seventh o&rsquo; them,<br />And never a word
spake he;<br />But he has striped his bright brown brand<br />Out through
Clerk Saunders&rsquo; fair bodye.</p>
<p>Clerk Saunders he started, and Margaret she turned<br />Into his
arms as asleep she lay;<br />And sad and silent was the night<br />That
was atween thir twae.</p>
<p>And they lay still and sleeped sound<br />Until the day began to
daw;<br />And kindly to him she did say,<br />&ldquo;It is time, true
love, you were awa&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he lay still, and sleeped sound,<br />Albeit the sun began to
sheen;<br />She looked atween her and the wa&rsquo;,<br />And dull and
drowsie were his e&rsquo;en.</p>
<p>Then in and came her father dear;<br />Said,&mdash;&ldquo;Let a&rsquo;
your mourning be:<br />I&rsquo;ll carry the dead corpse to the clay,<br />And
I&rsquo;ll come back and comfort thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort weel your seven sons;<br />For comforted will I never
be:<br />I ween &rsquo;twas neither knave nor loon<br />Was in the bower
last night wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clinking bell gaed through the town,<br />To carry the dead corse
to the clay;<br />And Clerk Saunders stood at may Margaret&rsquo;s window,<br />I
wot, an hour before the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye sleeping, Margaret?&rdquo; he says,<br />&ldquo;Or
are ye waking presentlie?<br />Give me my faith and troth again,<br />I
wot, true love, I gied to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your faith and troth ye sall never get,<br />Nor our true
love sall never twin,<br />Until ye come within my bower,<br />And kiss
me cheik and chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mouth it is full cold, Margaret,<br />It has the smell,
now, of the ground;<br />And if I kiss thy comely mouth,<br />Thy days
of life will not be lang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, cocks are crowing a merry midnight,<br />I wot the wild
fowls are boding day;<br />Give me my faith and troth again,<br />And
let me fare me on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy faith and troth thou sall na get,<br />And our true love
sall never twin,<br />Until ye tell what comes of women,<br />I wot,
who die in strong traivelling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their beds are made in the heavens high,<br />Down at the
foot of our good lord&rsquo;s knee,<br />Weel set about wi&rsquo; gillyflowers;<br />I
wot, sweet company for to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, cocks are crowing a merry midnight,<br />I wot the wild
fowl are boding day;<br />The psalms of heaven will soon be sung,<br />And
I, ere now, will be missed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she has ta&rsquo;en a crystal wand,<br />And she has stroken
her troth thereon;<br />She has given it him out at the shot-window,<br />Wi&rsquo;
mony a sad sigh, and heavy groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank ye, Marg&rsquo;ret, I thank ye, Marg&rsquo;ret;<br />And
aye I thank ye heartilie;<br />Gin ever the dead come for the quick,<br />Be
sure, Mag&rsquo;ret, I&rsquo;ll come for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hosen and shoon, and gown alone,<br />She climb&rsquo;d
the wall, and followed him,<br />Until she came to the green forest,<br />And
there she lost the sight o&rsquo; him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there ony room at your head, Saunders?<br />Is there ony
room at your feet?<br />Is there ony room at your side, Saunders,<br />Where
fain, fain I wad sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae room at my head, Marg&rsquo;ret,<br />There&rsquo;s
nae room at my feet;<br />My bed it is full lowly now,<br />Amang the
hungry worms I sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cauld mould is my covering now,<br />But and my winding-sheet;<br />The
dew it falls nae sooner down<br />Than my resting-place is weet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But plait a wand o&rsquo; bonnie birk,<br />And lay it on
my breast;<br />And shed a tear upon my grave,<br />And wish my saul
gude rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fair Marg&rsquo;ret, and rare Marg&rsquo;ret,<br />And
Marg&rsquo;ret, o&rsquo; veritie,<br />Gin ere ye love another man,<br />Ne&rsquo;er
love him as ye did me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and crew the milk-white cock,<br />And up and crew the gray;<br />Her
lover vanish&rsquo;d in the air,<br />And she gaed weeping away.</p>

Hairibee to hang him up?</p>
<p>Had Willie had but twenty men,<br />But twenty men as stout as be,<br />Fause
Sakelde had never the Kinmont taen<br />Wi eight score in his companie.</p>
<p>They band his legs beneath the steed,<br />They tied his hands behind
his back;<br />They guarded him, fivesome on each side,<br />And they
brought him ower the Liddel-rack.</p>
<p>They led him thro the Liddel-rack.<br />And also thro the Carlisle
sands;<br />They brought him to Carlisle castell.<br />To be at my Lord
Scroope&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands are tied; but my tongue is free,<br />And whae will
dare this deed avow?<br />Or answer by the border law?<br />Or answer

<p>&ldquo;Now haud thy tongue, thou rank reiver!<br />There&rsquo;s
never a Scot shall set ye free:<br />Before ye cross my castle-yate,<br />I

<p>&ldquo;Fear na ye that, my lord,&rdquo; quo Willie:<br />&ldquo;By

<p>&ldquo;And have they een taen him, Kinmont Willie,<br />Withouten
either dread or fear,<br />And forgotten that the bauld Bacleuch<br />Can
back a steed, or shake a spear?</p>
<p>&ldquo;O were there war between the lands,<br />As well I wot that

<p>There were five and five before them a&rsquo;,<br />Wi hunting-horns

Warden&rsquo;s men, arrayed for fight.</p>
<p>And five and five, like a mason-gang,<br />That carried the ladders
lang and hie;<br />And five and five, like broken men;<br />And so they

<p>And as we crossd the Bateable Land,<br />When to the English side

<p>&ldquo;Where be ye gaun, ye hunters keen?&rdquo;<br />Quo fause Sakelde;

<p>&ldquo;Why trespass ye on the English side?<br />Row-footed outlaws,
stand!&rdquo; quo he;<br />The neer a word had Dickie to say,<br />Sae
he thrust the lance thro his fause bodie.</p>
<p>Then on we held for Carlisle toun,<br />And at Staneshaw-bank the
Eden we crossd;<br />The water was great and meikle of spait,<br />But
the nevir a horse nor man we lost.</p>
<p>And when we reachd the Staneshaw-bank,<br />The wind was rising loud

that they should stamp and nie.</p>
<p>And when we left the Staneshaw-bank,<br />The wind began full loud
to blaw;<br />But &rsquo;twas wind and weet, and fire and sleet,<br />When
we came beneath the castell-wa.</p>
<p>We crept on knees, and held our breath,<br />Till we placed the ladders
against the wa;<br />And sae ready was Buccleuch himsell<br />To mount
she first, before us a&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He has taen the watchman by the throat,<br />He flung him down upon
the lead:<br />&ldquo;Had there not been peace between our lands,<br />Upon
the other side thou hadst gaed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sound out, trumpets!&rdquo; quo Buccleuch;<br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
waken Lord Scroope right merrilie!&rdquo;<br />Then loud the warden&rsquo;s
trumpet blew<br />&ldquo;O whae dare meddle wi me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then speedilie to wark we gaed,<br />And raised the slogan ane and
a&rsquo;,<br />And cut a hole through a sheet of lead,<br />And so we
wan to the castel-ha.</p>
<p>They thought King James and a&rsquo; his men<br />Had won the house
wi bow and speir;<br />It was but twenty Scots and ten<br />That put

<p>Wi coulters, and wi fore-hammers,<br />We garrd the bars bang merrilie,<br />Until

<p>And when we came to the lower prison,<br />Where Willie o Kinmont
he did lie,<br />&ldquo;O sleep ye, wake ye, Kinmont Willie,<br />Upon

<p>Then Red Rowan has hente him up,<br />The starkest man in Teviotdale:<br />&ldquo;Abide,
abide now, Red Rowan,<br />Till of my Lord Scroope I take farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, farewell, my gude Lord Scroope!<br />My gude Lord
Scroope, farewell!&rdquo; he cried;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for
my lodging-maill,<br />When first we meet on the border-side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then shoulder high, with shout and cry,<br />We bore him down the

airms playd clang!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mony a time,&rdquo; quo Kinmont Willie.<br />&ldquo;I have
ridden horse baith wild and wood;<br />But a rougher beast than Red
Rowan,<br />I ween my legs have neer bestrode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mony a time,&rdquo; quo Kinmont Willie,<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
pricked a horse out oure the furs;<br />But since the day I backed a
steed<br />I nevir wore sic cumbrous spurs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We scarce had won the Staneshaw-bank,<br />When a&rsquo; the Carlisle
bells were rung,<br />And a thousand men, in horse and foot,<br />Cam
wi the keen Lord Scroope along.</p>
<p>Buccleuch has turned to Eden Water,<br />Even where it flowd frae
bank to brim,<br />And he has plunged in wi a&rsquo; his band,<br />And
safely swam them thro the stream.</p>
<p>He turned him on the other side,<br />And at Lord Scroope his glove
flung he:<br />&ldquo;If ye like na my visit in merry England,<br />In
fair Scotland come visit me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sore astonished stood Lord Scroope,<br />He stood as still as
rock of stane;<br />He scarcely dared to trew his eyes,<br />When thro
the water they had gane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is either himsell a devil frae hell,<br />Or else his mother
a witch maun be;<br />I wad na have ridden that wan water<br />For a&rsquo;

<h2>Ballad: Jamie Telfer</h2>

<p>(Child, vol. vi.&nbsp; Early Edition.)</p>
<p>It fell about the Martinmas tyde,<br />When our Border steeds get
corn and hay<br />The captain of Bewcastle hath bound him to ryde,<br />And
he&rsquo;s ower to Tividale to drive a prey.</p>
<p>The first ae guide that they met wi&rsquo;,<br />It was high up Hardhaughswire;<br />The
second guide that we met wi&rsquo;,<br />It was laigh down in Borthwick
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tidings, what tidings, my trusty guide?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Nae
tidings, nae tidings, I hae to thee;<br />But, gin ye&rsquo;ll gae to
the fair Dodhead,<br />Mony a cow&rsquo;s cauf I&rsquo;ll let thee see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And whan they cam to the fair Dodhead,<br />Right hastily they clam
the peel;<br />They loosed the kye out, ane and a&rsquo;,<br />And ranshackled
the house right weel.</p>
<p>Now Jamie Telfer&rsquo;s heart was sair,<br />The tear aye rowing
in his e&rsquo;e;<br />He pled wi&rsquo; the captain to hae his gear,<br />Or
else revenged he wad be.</p>
<p>The captain turned him round and leugh;<br />Said&mdash;&ldquo;Man,
there&rsquo;s naething in thy house,<br />But ae auld sword without
a sheath,<br />That hardly now wad fell a mouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was na up, but the moon was down,<br />It was the gryming
o&rsquo; a new fa&rsquo;n snaw,<br />Jamie Telfer has run three myles
a-foot,<br />Between the Dodhead and the Stobs&rsquo;s Ha&rsquo;</p>
<p>And whan he cam to the fair tower yate,<br />He shouted loud, and
cried weel hie,<br />Till out bespak auld Gibby Elliot&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s
this that brings the fraye to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Jamie Telfer o&rsquo; the fair Dodhead,<br />And
a harried man I think I be!<br />There&rsquo;s naething left at the

<p>&ldquo;Gae seek your succour at Branksome Ha&rsquo;.<br />For succour
ye&rsquo;se get nane frae me!<br />Gae seek your succour where ye paid
black-mail,<br />For, man! ye ne&rsquo;er paid money to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamie has turned him round about,<br />I wat the tear blinded his
e&rsquo;e&mdash;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er pay mail to Elliot
again,<br />And the fair Dodhead I&rsquo;ll never see!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hounds may a&rsquo; rin masterless,<br />My hawks may fly
frae tree to tree;<br />My lord may grip my vassal lands,<br />For there
again maun I never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has turned him to the Tiviot side,<br />E&rsquo;en as fast as
he could drie,<br />Till he came to the Coultart Cleugh<br />And there
he shouted baith loud and hie.</p>
<p>Then up bespak him auld Jock Grieve&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s
this that brings the fray to me?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Jamie
Telfer o&rsquo; the fair Dodhead,<br />A harried man I trow I be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s naething left in the fair Dodhead,<br />But

<p>&ldquo;Alack a wae!&rdquo; quo&rsquo; auld Jock Grieve,<br />&ldquo;Alack!

<p>Then he has ta&rsquo;en out a bonny black,<br />Was right weel fed
wi&rsquo; corn and hay,<br />And he&rsquo;s set Jamie Telfer on his

<p>And whan he cam to the Catslockhill,<br />He shouted loud and weel
cried he,<br />Till out and spak him William&rsquo;s Wat&mdash;<br />&ldquo;O

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Jamie Telfer o&rsquo; the fair Dodhead,<br />A

<p>He&rsquo;s set his twa sons on coal-black steeds,<br />Himsel&rsquo;

Branksome Ha to tak the fray.</p>
<p>And whan they cam to Branksome Ha&rsquo;,<br />They shouted a&rsquo;

<p>The gear was driven the Frostylee up,<br />Frae the Frostylee unto

<p>&ldquo;Wha drives thir kye?&rdquo; &rsquo;gan Willie say,<br />&ldquo;To

<p>&ldquo;Set on them, lads!&rdquo; quo&rsquo; Willie than,<br />&ldquo;Fye,

<p>But Willie was stricken ower the head,<br />And through the knapscap
the sword has gane;<br />And Harden grat for very rage,<br />Whan Willie
on the ground lay slain.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;en aff his gude steel-cap,<br />And thrice
he&rsquo;s waved it in the air&mdash;<br />The Dinlay snaw was ne&rsquo;er

<p>O mony a horse ran masterless,<br />The splintered lances flew on
hie;<br />But or they wan to the Kershope ford,<br />The Scots had gotten
the victory.</p>
<p>John o&rsquo; Brigham there was slain,<br />And John o&rsquo; Barlow,
as I hear say;<br />And thirty mae o&rsquo; the captain&rsquo;s men,<br />Lay
bleeding on the grund that day.</p>
<p>The captain was run thro&rsquo; the thick of the thigh&mdash;<br />And
broken was his right leg bane;<br />If he had lived this hundred year,<br />He
had never been loved by woman again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hae back thy kye!&rdquo; the captain said;<br />&ldquo;Dear

will ne&rsquo;er fair lady smile on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then word is gane to the captain&rsquo;s bride,<br />Even in the
bower where that she lay,<br />That her lord was prisoner in enemy&rsquo;s
land,<br />Since into Tividale he had led the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wad lourd have had a winding-sheet,<br />And helped to put

<p>There was a wild gallant amang us a&rsquo;,<br />His name was Watty

<p>When they cam to the Stanegirthside,<br />They dang wi&rsquo; trees,
and burst the door;<br />They loosed out a&rsquo; the captain&rsquo;s

<p>There was an auld wife ayont the fire,<br />A wee bit o&rsquo; the
captain&rsquo;s kin&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Wha daur loose out the captain&rsquo;s

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Watty Wudspurs, loose the kye,<br />I winna
layne my name frae thee!<br />And I will loose out the captain&rsquo;s
kye,<br />In scorn of a&rsquo; his men and he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they cam to the fair Dodhead,<br />They were a wellcum sight
to see!<br />For instead of his ain ten milk-kye,<br />Jamie Telfer
has gotten thirty and three.</p>
<p>And he has paid the rescue shot,<br />Baith wi&rsquo; goud, and white

the best of wine;<br />And every health she drank unto him<br />Was
&ldquo;I wish, Lord Bateman, as you was mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O have you got houses, have you got land,<br />And does Northumberland
belong to thee?<br />And what would you give to the fair young lady<br />As
out of prison would let you go free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I&rsquo;ve got houses and I&rsquo;ve got land,<br />And
half Northumberland belongs to me;<br />And I will give it all to the
fair young lady<br />As out of prison would let me go free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O in seven long years I&rsquo;ll make a vow<br />For seven
long years, and keep it strong,<br />That if you&rsquo;ll wed no other
woman,<br />O I will wed no other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O she took him to her father&rsquo;s harbor,<br />And gave to him
a ship of fame,<br />Saying, &ldquo;Farewell, farewell to you, Lord
Bateman,<br />I fear I shall never see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now seven long years is gone and past,<br />And fourteen days, well
known to me;<br />She packed up all her gay clothing,<br />And swore
Lord Bateman she would go see.</p>
<p>O when she arrived at Lord Bateman&rsquo;s castle,<br />How boldly
then she rang the bell!<br />&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
cries the proud young porter,<br />&ldquo;O come unto me pray quickly
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O is this here Lord Bateman&rsquo;s castle,<br />And is his
lordship here within?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;O yes, O yes,&rdquo; cries
the proud young porter,<br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just now taking his young
bride in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O bid him to send me a slice of bread,<br />And a bottle of
the very best wine,<br />And not forgetting the fair young lady<br />As
did release him when close confine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O away and away went this proud young porter,<br />O away and away
and away went he,<br />Until he came to Lord Bateman&rsquo;s chamber,<br />Where
he went down on his bended knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news, what news, my proud young porter?<br />What news,
what news? come tell to me:&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;O there is the fairest
young lady<br />As ever my two eyes did see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has got rings on every finger,<br />And on one finger
she has got three;<br />With as much gay gold about her middle<br />As
would buy half Northumberlee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O she bids you to send her a slice of bread,<br />And a bottle
of the very best wine,<br />And not forgetting the fair young lady<br />As
did release you when close confine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Bateman then in passion flew,<br />And broke his sword in splinters
three,<br />Saying, &ldquo;I will give half of my father&rsquo;s land,<br />If
so be as Sophia has crossed the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spoke this young bride&rsquo;s mother,<br />Who never
was heard to speak so free;<br />Saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not forget
my only daughter,<br />If so be Sophia has crossed the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O it&rsquo;s true I made a bride of your daughter,<br />But
she&rsquo;s neither the better nor the worse for me;<br />She came to
me with a horse and saddle,<br />But she may go home in a coach and
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Bateman then prepared another marriage,<br />With both their
hearts so full of glee,<br />Saying, &ldquo;I will roam no more to foreign
countries,<br />Now that Sophia has crossed the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Ballad: Edom O&rsquo; Gordon</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It fell about the Martinmas,<br />When the wind blew shrill and cauld,<br />Said
Edom o&rsquo; Gordon to his men,&mdash;<br />&ldquo;We maun draw to
a hald. <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12">{12}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And whatna hald shall we draw to,<br />My merry men and me?<br />We
will gae straight to Towie house,<br />To see that fair ladye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[The ladye stood on her castle wall,<br />Beheld baith dale and down;<br />There
she was &rsquo;ware of a host of men<br />Came riding towards the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, see ye not, my merry men all,<br />Oh, see ye not what
I see?<br />Methinks I see a host of men;<br />I marvel who they be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought it had been her own wed lord.<br />As he came riding
hame;<br />It was the traitor, Edom o&rsquo; Gordon,<br />Wha reck&rsquo;d
nae sin nor shame.]</p>
<p>She had nae sooner buskit hersel&rsquo;,<br />And putten on her gown,<br />Till
Edom o&rsquo; Gordon and his men<br />Were round about the town.</p>
<p>They had nae sooner supper set,<br />Nae sooner said the grace,<br />Till
Edom o&rsquo; Gordon and his men<br />Were round about the place.</p>
<p>The ladye ran to her tower head,<br />As fast as she cou&rsquo;d
hie,<br />To see if, by her fair speeches,<br />She cou&rsquo;d with
him agree.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw this ladye fair.<br />And her yetts all lockit
fast,<br />He fell into a rage of wrath,<br />And his heart was all
aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down to me, ye ladye gay,<br />Come down, come down to
me;<br />This night ye shall lye within my arms,<br />The morn my bride
shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I winna come down, ye false Gordon,<br />I winna come down
to thee;<br />I winna forsake my ain dear lord,<br />That is sae far
frae me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e up your house, ye ladye fair,<br />Gi&rsquo;e up
your house to me;<br />Or I shall burn yoursel&rsquo; therein,<br />Bot

<p>&ldquo;I winna gi&rsquo;e up, ye false Gordon,<br />To nae sic traitor

and my babies three.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;But fetch to me my pistolette,<br />And charge to me my gun;<br />For,
but if I pierce that bluidy butcher,<br />My babes we will be undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stiffly stood on her castle wall,<br />And let the bullets flee;<br />She
miss&rsquo;d that bluidy butcher&rsquo;s heart,<br />Tho&rsquo; she
slew other three.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set fire to the house!&rdquo; quo&rsquo; the false Gordon,<br />&ldquo;Since
better may nae be;<br />And I will burn hersel&rsquo; therein,<br />Bot
and her babies three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wae worth, wae worth ye, Jock, my man,<br />I paid ye weel

<p>Oh, then out spake her youngest son,<br />Sat on the nurse&rsquo;s
knee:<br />Says&mdash;&ldquo;Mither dear, gi&rsquo;e o&rsquo;er this

<p>[&ldquo;I wou&rsquo;d gi&rsquo;e all my gold, my bairn,<br />Sae
wou&rsquo;d I all my fee,<br />For ae blast of the westlin&rsquo; wind,<br />To

<p>&ldquo;But I winna gi&rsquo;e up my house, my dear,<br />To nae sic

<p>Oh, then out spake her daughter dear,<br />She was baith jimp and
small:<br />&ldquo;Oh, row me in a pair of sheets,<br />And tow me o&rsquo;er

<p>They row&rsquo;d her in a pair of sheets,<br />And tow&rsquo;d her
o&rsquo;er the wall;<br />But on the point of Gordon&rsquo;s spear<br />She
got a deadly fall.</p>
<p>Oh, bonnie, bonnie was her mouth,<br />And cherry were her cheeks;<br />And
clear, clear was her yellow hair,<br />Whereon the red bluid dreeps.</p>
<p>Then with his spear he turn&rsquo;d her o&rsquo;er,<br />Oh, gin
her face was wan!<br />He said&mdash;&ldquo;You are the first that e&rsquo;er<br />I
wish&rsquo;d alive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turn&rsquo;d her o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er again,<br />Oh, gin
her skin was white!<br />&ldquo;I might ha&rsquo;e spared that bonnie

<p>&ldquo;Busk and boun, my merry men all,<br />For ill dooms I do guess;<br />I

<p>[But when the ladye saw the fire<br />Come flaming o&rsquo;er her
head,<br />She wept, and kissed her children twain;<br />Said&mdash;&ldquo;Bairns,

<p>The Gordon then his bugle blew,<br />And said&mdash;&ldquo;Away,
away!<br />The house of Towie is all in a flame,<br />I hald it time
to gae.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Oh, then he spied her ain dear lord,<br />As he came o&rsquo;er the

<p>Then sair, oh sair his mind misgave,<br />And oh, his heart was wae!<br />&ldquo;Put

<p>[He wrang his hands, he rent his hair,<br />And wept in tearful mood;<br />&ldquo;Ah,

<p>And after the Gordon he has gane,<br />Sae fast as he might drie;<br />And

<p>(Child, vol. iv.&nbsp; Early Edition.)</p>
<p>Balow, my boy, ly still and sleep,<br />It grieves me sore to hear
thee weep,<br />If thou&rsquo;lt be silent, I&rsquo;ll be glad,<br />Thy
mourning makes my heart full sad.<br />Balow, my boy, thy mother&rsquo;s
joy,<br />Thy father bred one great annoy.<br />Balow, my boy, ly still
and sleep,<br />It grieves me sore to hear thee weep.</p>
<p>Balow, my darling, sleep a while,<br />And when thou wak&rsquo;st
then sweetly smile;<br />But smile not as thy father did,<br />To cozen
maids, nay, God forbid;<br />For in thine eye his look I see,<br />The
tempting look that ruin&rsquo;d me.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>When he began to court my love,<br />And with his sugar&rsquo;d words
to move,<br />His tempting face, and flatt&rsquo;ring chear,<br />In
time to me did not appear;<br />But now I see that cruel he<br />Cares
neither for his babe nor me.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>Fareweel, fareaeel, thou falsest youth<br />That ever kist a woman&rsquo;s
mouth.<br />Let never any after me<br />Submit unto thy courtesy!<br />For,
if hey do, O! cruel thou<br />Wilt her abuse and care not how!<br />Balow,
my boy, etc.</p>
<p>I was too cred&rsquo;lous at the first,<br />To yield thee all a
maiden durst.<br />Thou swore for ever true to prove,<br />Thy faith
unchang&rsquo;d, unchang&rsquo;d thy love;<br />But quick as thought
the change is wrought,<br />Thy love&rsquo;s no mair, thy promise nought.<br />Balow,
my boy, etc.</p>
<p>I wish I were a maid again!<br />From young men&rsquo;s flatt&rsquo;ry
I&rsquo;d refrain;<br />For now unto my grief I find<br />They all are
perjur&rsquo;d and unkind;<br />Bewitching charms bred all my harms;&mdash;<br />Witness
my babe lies in my arms.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>I take my fate from bad to worse,<br />That I must needs be now a
nurse,<br />And lull my young son on my lap:<br />From me, sweet orphan,
take the pap.<br />Balow, my child, thy mother mild<br />Shall wail
as from all bliss exil&rsquo;d.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>Balow, my boy, weep not for me,<br />Whose greatest grief&rsquo;s
for wronging thee.<br />Nor pity her deserved smart,<br />Who can blame
none but her fond heart;<br />For, too soon tursting latest finds<br />With
fairest tongues are falsest minds.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>Balow, my boy, thy father&rsquo;s fled,<br />When he the thriftless
son has played;<br />Of vows and oaths forgetful, he<br />Preferr&rsquo;d
the wars to thee and me.<br />But now, perhaps, thy curse and mine<br />Make
him eat acorns with the swine.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>But curse not him; perhaps now he,<br />Stung with remorse, is blessing
thee:<br />Perhaps at death; for who can tell<br />Whether the judge
of heaven or hell,<br />By some proud foe has struck the blow,<br />And
laid the dear deceiver low?<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>I wish I were into the bounds<br />Where he lies smother&rsquo;d
in his wounds,<br />Repeating, as he pants for air,<br />My name, whom
once he call&rsquo;d his fair;<br />No woman&rsquo;s yet so fiercely

<p>If linen lacks, for my love&rsquo;s sake<br />Then quickly to him

in that winding-sheet.<br />Ah me! how happy had I been,<br />If he
had ne&rsquo;er been wrapt therein.<br />Balow, my boy, etc.</p>
<p>Balow, my boy, I&rsquo;ll weep for thee;<br />Too soon, alake, thou&rsquo;lt
weep for me:<br />Thy griefs are growing to a sum,<br />God grant thee
patience when they come;<br />Born to sustain thy mother&rsquo;s shame,<br />A

<p>Now Liddisdale has ridden a raid,<br />But I wat they had better

son Johnie is prisner tane?<br />With my fa ding diddle, la la dew diddle.</p>
<p>For Mangerton house auld Downie is gane,<br />Her coats she has kilted
up to her knee;<br />And down the water wi speed she rins,<br />While
tears in spaits fa fast frae her eie.</p>
<p>Then up and bespake the lord Mangerton:<br />&ldquo;What news, what
news, sister Downie, to me?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Bad news, bad news, my
lord Mangerton;<br />Mitchel is killd, and tane they hae my son Johnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neer fear, sister Downie,&rdquo; quo Mangerton;<br />&ldquo;I
hae yokes of oxen, four-and-twentie,<br />My barns, my byres, and my

ere Johnie shall die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three men I&rsquo;ll take to set him free,<br />Weel harnessd
a&rsquo; wi best of steel;<br />The English rogues may hear, and drie<br />The
weight o their braid swords to feel</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Laird&rsquo;s Jock ane, the Laird&rsquo;s Wat twa,<br />O
Hobie Noble, thou ane maun be!<br />Thy coat is blue, thou has been
true,<br />Since England banishd thee, to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Hobie was an English man,<br />In Bewcastle-dale was bred and
born;<br />But his misdeeds they were sae great,<br />They banished
him neer to return.</p>
<p>Lord Mangerton then orders gave,&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Your horses the
wrang way maun a&rsquo; be shod;<br />Like gentlemen ye must not seem,<br />But
look like corn-caugers gawn ae road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your armour gude ye maunna shaw,<br />Nor ance appear like
men o weir;<br />As country lads be all arrayd,<br />Wi branks and brecham
on ilk mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sae now a&rsquo; their horses are shod the wrang way,<br />And Hobie
has mounted his grey sae fine,<br />Jock his lively bay, Wat&rsquo;s
on his white horse behind,<br />And on they rode for the water o Tyne.</p>
<p>At the Cholerford they a&rsquo; light down,<br />And there, wi the
help o the light o the moon,<br />A tree they cut, wi fifteen naggs
upon each side,<br />To climb up the wall of Newcastle toun.</p>
<p>But when they came to Newcastle toun,<br />And were alighted at the
wa,<br />They fand their tree three ells oer laigh,<br />They fand their
stick baith short aid sma.</p>
<p>Then up and spake the Laird&rsquo;s ain Jock,<br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
naething for&rsquo;t; the gates we maun force.&rdquo;<br />But when
they cam the gate unto,<br />A proud porter withstood baith men and
horse.</p>
<p>His neck in twa I wat they hae wrung;<br />Wi foot or hand he neer
play&rsquo;d paw;<br />His life and his keys at anes they hae taen,<br />And
cast his body ahind the wa.</p>
<p>Now soon they reached Newcastle jail,<br />And to the prisner thus
they call:<br />&ldquo;Sleips thou, wakes thou, Jock o the Side,<br />Or
is thou wearied o thy thrall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jock answers thus, wi dolefu tone:<br />&ldquo;Aft, aft I wake, I
seldom sleip;<br />But wha&rsquo;s this kens my name sae weel,<br />And
thus to hear my waes does seek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spake the good Laird&rsquo;s Jock:<br />&ldquo;Neer fear

Jock, the Laird&rsquo;s Wat,<br />And Hobie Noble, come to set thee

<p>&ldquo;Oh, had thy tongue, and speak nae mair,<br />And o thy talk
now let me be!<br />For if a&rsquo; Liddesdale were here the night,<br />The

<p>The first strong dore that they came at,<br />They loosed it without

a&rsquo; in flinders flee.</p>
<p>The prisner now, upo his back,<br />The Laird&rsquo;s Jock&rsquo;s

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jock, I wat,&rdquo; quo Hobie Noble,<br />&ldquo;Part

quo the Laird&rsquo;s Jock<br />&ldquo;I count him lighter than a flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sae out at the gates they a&rsquo; are gane,<br />The prisner&rsquo;s

<p>&ldquo;O Jock, sae winsomely&rsquo;s ye ride,<br />Wi baith your

<p>The night, tho wat, they didna mind,<br />But hied them on fu mirrilie,<br />Until
they cam to Cholerford brae,<br />Where the water ran like mountains

<p>But when they came to Cholerford,<br />There they met with an auld

<p>&ldquo;I wat weel no,&rdquo; quo the good auld man;<br />&ldquo;Here

<p>Sae now the water they a&rsquo; hae tane,<br />By anes and &rsquo;twas

says the Laird&rsquo;s Jock,<br />&ldquo;And, poor faint Wat, what think

<p>And whan she cam into the kirk,<br />She shimmerd like the sun;<br />The

<p>She sat her by the nut-browne bride,<br />And her een they wer sae

<p>The bride she drew a long bodkin<br />Frae out her gay head-gear,<br />And

<p>Lord Thomas he saw Fair Annet wex pale,<br />And marvelit what mote

<p>Late at e&rsquo;en, drinking the wine,<br />And ere they paid the

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stay at hame, my noble lord,<br />Oh, stay at hame, my

<p>She kiss&rsquo;d his cheek, she kaim&rsquo;d his hair,<br />As oft

he&rsquo;s away to Yarrow.</p>
<p>As he gaed up the Tennies bank,<br />I wot he gaed wi&rsquo; sorrow,<br />Till,

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come ye here to part your land,<br />The bonnie Forest

<p>&ldquo;Gae hame, gae hame, good-brother John,<br />And tell your

<p>Then out it spake the king again,<br />Says, &ldquo;Bonny boy, tell

<p>&ldquo;Yet she had twa as fu fair sons<br />As ever the sun did see,<br />An
the tane of them lood my sister dear,<br />An the tother said he lood

<p>Then out it spake him Bold Arthur,<br />As by the king he stood:<br />&ldquo;Now,

<p>Then in it came him Brown Robin,<br />Frae hunting O the deer;<br />But
whan he saw the king was there,<br />He started back for fear.</p>
<p>The king has taen him by the hand,<br />An bide him naithing dread;<br />Says,
&ldquo;Ye maun leave the good greenwood,<br />Come to the court wi speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up he took White Lilly&rsquo;s son,<br />An set him on his knee;<br />Says&mdash;&ldquo;Gin

<p>(Child, vol. vii.&nbsp; Early Edition, Appendix.)</p>
<p>Frae Dunidier as I cam throuch,<br />Doun by the hill of Banochie,<br />Allangst
the lands of Garioch.<br />Grit pitie was to heir and se<br />The noys
and dulesum hermonie,<br />That evir that dreiry day did daw!<br />Cryand
the corynoch on hie,<br />Alas! alas! for the Harlaw.</p>
<p>I marvlit what the matter meant;<br />All folks were in a fiery fariy:<br />I
wist nocht wha was fae or freind,<br />Yet quietly I did me carrie.<br />But
sen the days of auld King Hairy,<br />Sic slauchter was not hard nor
sene,<br />And thair I had nae tyme to tairy,<br />For bissiness in
Aberdene.</p>
<p>Thus as I walkit on the way,<br />To Inverury as I went,<br />I met
a man, and bad him stay,<br />Requeisting him to mak me quaint<br />Of
the beginning and the event<br />That happenit thair at the Harlaw;<br />Then
he entreited me to tak tent,<br />And he the truth sould to me schaw.</p>
<p>Grit Donald of the Ysles did claim<br />Unto the lands of Ross sum

<p>Then haistylie he did command<br />That all his weir-men should convene;<br />Ilk

<p>Then all the countrie men did yield;<br />For nae resistans durst

to beir him bak.<br />Syne they resolvit all and spak,<br />That best

<p>Then he a proclamation maid,<br />All men to meet at Inverness,<br />Throw

<p>And then throw fair Strathbogie land<br />His purpose was for to

<p>Without resistans, as he said,<br />Throw all these parts he stoutly

<p>To hinder this prowd enterprise,<br />The stout and michty Erl of
Marr<br />With all his men in arms did ryse,<br />Even frae Curgarf
to Craigyvar:<br />And down the syde of Don richt far,<br />Angus and
Mearns did all convene<br />To fecht, or Donald came sae nar<br />The

<p>And thus the martial Erle of Marr<br />Marcht with his men in richt

<h2>Ballad: May Colven</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Child, Part I., p. 56.)</p>
<p>False Sir John a wooing came<br />To a maid of beauty fair;<br />May
Colven was this lady&rsquo;s name,<br />Her father&rsquo;s only heir.</p>
<p>He wood her butt, he wood her ben,<br />He wood her in the ha,<br />Until
he got this lady&rsquo;s consent<br />To mount and ride awa.</p>
<p>He went down to her father&rsquo;s bower,<br />Where all the steeds
did stand,<br />And he&rsquo;s taken one of the best steeds<br />That
was in her father&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got on and she&rsquo;s got on,<br />As fast as they could
flee,<br />Until they came to a lonesome part,<br />A rock by the side
of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loup off the steed,&rdquo; says false Sir John,<br />&ldquo;Your
bridal bed you see;<br />For I have drowned seven young ladies,<br />The
eighth one you shall be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast off, cast off, my May Colven,<br />All and your silken
gown,<br />For it&rsquo;s oer good and oer costly<br />To rot in the
salt sea foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast off, cast off, my May Colven.<br />All and your embroiderd
shoen,<br />For oer good and oer costly<br />To rot in the salt sea
foam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O turn you about, O false Sir John,<br />And look to the leaf
of the tree,<br />For it never became a gentleman<br />A naked woman
to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned himself straight round about,<br />To look to the leaf
of the tree,<br />So swift as May Colven was<br />To throw him in the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O help, O help, my May Colven,<br />O help, or else I&rsquo;ll
drown;<br />I&rsquo;ll take you home to your father&rsquo;s bower,<br />And
set you down safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No help, no help, O false Sir John,<br />No help, nor pity
thee;<br />Tho&rsquo; seven kings&rsquo; daughters you have drownd,<br />But
the eighth shall not be me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went on her father&rsquo;s steed,<br />As swift as she could
flee,<br />And she came home to her father&rsquo;s bower<br />Before
it was break of day.</p>
<p>Up then and spoke the pretty parrot:<br />&ldquo;May Colven, where
have you been?<br />What has become of false Sir John,<br />That woo&rsquo;d
you so late the streen?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He woo&rsquo;d you butt, he woo&rsquo;d you ben,<br />He woo&rsquo;d
you in the ha,<br />Until he got your own consent<br />For to mount
and gang awa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O hold your tongue, my pretty parrot,<br />Lay not the blame
upon me;<br />Your cup shall be of the flowered gold,<br />Your cage
of the root of the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up then spake the king himself,<br />In the bed-chamber where he
lay:<br />&ldquo;What ails the pretty parrot,<br />That prattles so
long or day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There came a cat to my cage door,<br />It almost a worried
me,<br />And I was calling on May Colven<br />To take the cat from me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Ballad: Hobbie Noble</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Child, vi.&nbsp; Early Edition.)</p>
<p>Foul fa&rsquo; the breast first treason bred in!<br />That Liddesdale
may safely say:<br />For in it there was baith meat and drink,<br />And
corn unto our geldings gay.</p>
<p>We were stout-hearted men and true,<br />As England it did often
say;<br />But now we may turn our backs and fly,<br />Since brave Noble
is seld away.</p>
<p>Now Hobie he was an English man,<br />And born into Bewcastle dale;<br />But
his misdeeds they were sae great,<br />They banish&rsquo;d him to Liddisdale.</p>
<p>At Kershope foot the tryst was set,<br />Kershope of the lilye lee;<br />And
there was traitour Sim o&rsquo; the Mains,<br />With him a private companie.</p>
<p>Then Hobie has graith&rsquo;d his body weel,<br />I wat it was wi&rsquo;
baith good iron and steel;<br />And he has pull&rsquo;d out his fringed
grey,<br />And there, brave Noble, he rade him weel.</p>
<p>Then Hobie is down the water gane,<br />E&rsquo;en as fast as he
may drie;<br />Tho&rsquo; they shoud a&rsquo; brusten and broken their
hearts,<br />Frae that tryst Noble he would na be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel may ye be, my feiries five!<br />And aye, what is your
wills wi&rsquo; me?&rdquo;<br />Then they cry&rsquo;d a&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
ae consent,<br />&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt welcome here, brave Noble, to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou with us in England ride,<br />And thy safe warrand
we will be?<br />If we get a horse worth a hundred punds,<br />Upon
his back that thou shalt be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not with you into England ride;<br />The Land-sergeant
has me at feid:<br />I know not what evil may betide,<br />For Peter
of Whitfield, his brother, is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Anton Shiel he loves not me,<br />For I gat twa drifts
o his sheep;<br />The great Earl of Whitfield loves me not,<br />For
nae gear frae me he e&rsquo;er could keep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will ye stay till the day gae down,<br />Until the night
come o&rsquo;er the grund,<br />And I&rsquo;ll be a guide worth ony
twa,<br />That may in Liddesdale be fund?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tho&rsquo; dark the night as pitch and tar,<br />I&rsquo;ll
guide ye o&rsquo;er yon hills fu&rsquo; hie;<br />And bring ye a&rsquo;
in safety back,<br />If ye&rsquo;ll be true and follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s guided them o&rsquo;er moss and muir,<br />O&rsquo;er
hill and houp, and mony a down;<br />Til they came to the Foulbogshiel,<br />And
there, brave Noble, he lighted down.</p>
<p>But word is gane to the Land-sergeant,<br />In Askirton where that
he lay&mdash;<br />&ldquo;The deer that ye hae hunted lang,<br />Is
seen into the Waste this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Hobbie Noble is that deer!<br />I wat he carries the
style fu&rsquo; hie;<br />Aft has he beat your slough-hounds back,<br />And
set yourselves at little lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar warn the bows of Hartlie-burn;<br />See they shaft their
arrows on the wa&rsquo;!<br />Warn Willeva and Spear Edom,<br />And
see the morn they meet me a&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar meet me on the Rodric-haugh,<br />And see it be by break
o&rsquo; day;<br />And we will on to Conscowthart-Green,<br />For there,
I think, we&rsquo;ll get our prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hobbie Noble has dream&rsquo;d a dream,<br />In the Foulbogshiel,
where that he lay;<br />He thought his horse was neath him shot,<br />And
he himself got hard away.</p>
<p>The cocks could crow, the day could dawn,<br />And I wot so even
down fell the rain;<br />If Hobbie had no waken&rsquo;d at that time,<br />In
the Foulbogshiel he had been tane or slain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, get up, my feiries five!<br />For I wot here makes
a fu&rsquo; ill day;<br />Yet the warst cloak of this companie,<br />I
hope, shall cross the Waste this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Hobie thought the gates were clear;<br />But, ever alas! it was
not sae:<br />They were beset wi&rsquo; cruel men and keen,<br />That
away brave Hobbie could not gae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet follow me, my feiries five,<br />And see of me ye keep
good ray;<br />And the worst cloak o&rsquo; this companie<br />I hope
shall cross the Waste this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was heaps of men now Hobbie before,<br />And other heaps was
him behind,<br />That had he wight as Wallace was,<br />Away brave Noble
he could not win.</p>
<p>Then Hobie he had but a laddies sword;<br />But he did more than
a laddies deed;<br />In the midst of Conscouthart-Green,<br />He brake
it oer Jersawigham&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Now they have tane brave Hobie Noble,<br />Wi&rsquo; his ain bowstring
they band him sae;<br />And I wat heart was ne&rsquo;er sae sair,<br />As
when his ain five band him on the brae.</p>
<p>They have tane him on for West Carlisle;<br />They ask&rsquo;d him
if he knew the why?<br />Whate&rsquo;er he thought, yet little he said;<br />He
knew the way as well as they.</p>
<p>They hae ta&rsquo;en him up the Ricker gate;<br />The wives they
cast their windows wide;<br />And every wife to anither can say,<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the man loos&rsquo;d Jock o&rsquo; the Side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fye on ye, women! why ca&rsquo; ye me man?<br />For it&rsquo;s
nae man that I&rsquo;m used like;<br />I am but like a forfoughen hound,<br />Has
been fighting in a dirty syke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they hae tane him up thro&rsquo; Carlisle town,<br />And set
him by the chimney fire;<br />They gave brave Noble a wheat loaf to
eat,<br />And that was little his desire.</p>
<p>Then they gave him a wheat loaf to eat,<br />And after that a can
o beer;<br />Then they cried a&rsquo; with ae consent,<br />&ldquo;Eat,
brave Noble, and make gude cheer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confess my lord&rsquo;s horse, Hobie,&rdquo; they said,<br />&ldquo;And
the morn in Carlisle thou&rsquo;s no die;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;How shall
I confess them,&rdquo; Hobie says,<br />&ldquo;For I never saw them
with mine eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hobie has sworn a fu&rsquo; great aith,<br />By the day that
he was gotten and born,<br />He never had ony thing o&rsquo; my lord&rsquo;s,<br />That
either eat him grass or corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now fare thee weel, sweet Mangerton!<br />For I think again
I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er thee see:<br />I wad betray nae lad alive,<br />For
a&rsquo; the goud in Christentie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fare thee weel, sweet Liddesdale!<br />Baith the hie land
and the law;<br />Keep ye weel frae traitor Mains!<br />For goud and
gear he&rsquo;ll sell ye a&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet wad I rather be ca&rsquo;d Hobie Noble,<br />In Carlisle
where he suffers for his faut,<br />Before I&rsquo;d be ca&rsquo;d traitor

<h2>Ballad: Mary Ambree</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>(Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, vol. ii. p. 230.)</p>
<p>When captaines couragious, whom death cold not daunte,<br />Did march
to the siege of the citty of Gaunt,<br />They mustred their souldiers
by two and by three,<br />And the formost in battle was Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>When [the] brave sergeant-major was slaine in her sight,<br />Who
was her true lover, her joy, and delight,<br />Because he was slaine
most treacherouslie<br />Then vowd to revenge him Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>She clothed herselfe from the top to the toe<br />In buffe of the
bravest, most seemelye to showe;<br />A faire shirt of male then slipped
on shee:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>A helmett of proofe shee strait did provide,<br />A stronge arminge-sword
shee girt by her side,<br />On her hand a goodly faire gauntlett put
shee:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>Then tooke shee her sworde and her targett in hand,<br />Bidding
all such, as wold, [to] bee of her band;<br />To wayte on her person
came thousand and three:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary
Ambree?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soldiers,&rdquo; she saith, &ldquo;soe valliant and bold,<br />Nowe
followe your captaine, whom you doe beholde;<br />Still formost in battell
myselfe will I bee:&rdquo;<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary
Ambree?</p>
<p>Then cryed out her souldiers, and loude they did say,<br />&ldquo;Soe
well thou becomest this gallant array,<br />Thy harte and thy weapons
so well do agree,<br />No mayden was ever like Mary Ambree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cheared her souldiers, that foughten for life,<br />With ancyent
and standard, with drum and with fife,<br />With brave clanging trumpetts,
that sounded so free;<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I will see the worst of you all<br />To come into danger
of death or of thrall,<br />This hand and this life I will venture so
free:&rdquo;<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>Shee ledd upp her souldiers in battaile array,<br />Gainst three
times theyr number by breake of the daye;<br />Seven howers in skirmish
continued shee:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>She filled the skyes with the smoke of her shott,<br />And her enemyes
bodyes with bulletts so hott;<br />For one of her own men a score killed
shee:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>And when her false gunner, to spoyle her intent,<br />Away all her
pellets and powder had sent,<br />Straight with her keen weapon she
slasht him in three:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>Being falselye betrayed for lucre of hyre,<br />At length she was
forced to make a retyre;<br />Then her souldiers into a strong castle
drew shee:<br />Was not this a brave bonny lasse, Mary Ambree?</p>
<p>Her foes they besett her on everye side,<br />As thinking close siege
shee cold never abide;<br />To beate down the walles they all did decree:<br />But
stoutlye deffyd them brave Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>Then tooke shee her sword and her targett in hand,<br />And mounting
the walls all undaunted did stand,<br />There daring their captaines
to match any three:<br />O what a brave captaine was Mary Ambree!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now saye, English captaine, what woldest thou give<br />To
ransome thy selfe, which else must not live?<br />Come yield thy selfe
quicklye, or slaine thou must bee:&rdquo;<br />Then smiled sweetlye
brave Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye captaines couragious, of valour so bold,<br />Whom thinke
you before you now you doe behold?<br />&ldquo;A knight, sir, of England,
and captaine soe free,<br />Who shortlye with us a prisoner must bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No captaine of England; behold in your sight<br />Two brests
in my bosome, and therefore no knight:<br />Noe knight, sirs, of England,
nor captaine you see,<br />But a poor simple mayden called Mary Ambree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But art thou a woman, as thou dost declare,<br />Whose valor
hath proved so undaunted in warre?<br />If England doth yield such brave
maydens as thee,<br />Full well mey they conquer, faire Mary Ambree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of Great Parma heard of her renowne,<br />Who long had
advanced for England&rsquo;s fair crowne;<br />Hee wooed her and sued
her his mistress to bee,<br />And offered rich presents to Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>But this virtuous mayden despised them all:<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Ile
nere sell my honour for purple nor pall;<br />A maiden of England, sir,
never will bee<br />The wench of a monarcke,&rdquo; quoth Mary Ambree.</p>
<p>Then to her owne country shee back did returne,<br />Still holding
the foes of rare England in scorne!<br />Therfore English captaines
of every degree<br />Sing forth the brave valours of Mary Ambree.</p>

mony fair speeches she made to me.</p>
<p>She straik&rsquo;d my head, and she kaim&rsquo;d my hair,<br />And
she set me down saftly on her knee;<br />Says&mdash;&ldquo;If ye will

<h2>Ballad: The Heir Of Lynne</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all the lords in faire Scotland<br />A song I will begin:<br />Amongst
them all dwelled a lord<br />Which was the unthrifty Lord of Lynne.</p>
<p>His father and mother were dead him froe,<br />And so was the head
of all his kinne;<br />He did neither cease nor blinne<br />To the cards
and dice that he did run.</p>
<p>To drinke the wine that was so cleere!<br />With every man he would
make merry.<br />And then bespake him John of the Scales,<br />Unto
the heire of Lynne say&rsquo;d hee,</p>
<p>Sayes &ldquo;how dost thou, Lord of Lynne,<br />Doest either want
gold or fee?<br />Wilt thou not sell thy land so brode<br />To such
a good fellow as me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;For . . I . . &ldquo; he said,<br />&ldquo;My land, take it
unto thee;<br />I draw you to record, my lords all;&rdquo;<br />With
that he cast him a Gods pennie.</p>
<p>He told him the gold upon the bord,<br />It wanted never a bare penny.<br />&ldquo;That
gold is thine, the land is mine,<br />The heire of Lynne I will bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heeres gold enough,&rdquo; saithe the heire of Lynne,<br />&ldquo;Both
for me and my company.&rdquo;<br />He drunke the wine that was so cleere,<br />And
with every man he made merry.</p>
<p>Within three quarters of a yeare<br />His gold and fee it waxed thinne,<br />His
merry men were from him gone,<br />And left himselfe all alone.</p>
<p>He had never a penny left in his purse,<br />Never a penny but three,<br />And
one was brasse and another was lead<br />And another was white mony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now well-a-day!&rdquo; said the heire of Lynne,<br />&ldquo;Now
well-a-day, and woe is mee!<br />For when I was the Lord of Lynne,<br />I
neither wanted gold nor fee;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I have sold my lands so broad,<br />And have not left
me one penny!<br />I must go now and take some read<br />Unto Edenborrow
and beg my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not beene in Edenborrow<br />Nor three quarters of a yeare,<br />But
some did give him and some said nay,<br />And some bid &ldquo;to the
deele gang yee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For if we should hang some land selfeer,<br />The first we
would begin with thee.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Now well-a-day!&rdquo; said
the heire of Lynne,<br />&ldquo;Now well-a-day, and woe is mee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now I have sold my lands so broad<br />That merry man
is irke with mee;<br />But when that I was the Lord of Lynne<br />Then
on my land I lived merrily;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I have sold my land so broade<br />That I have not
left me one pennye!<br />God be with my father!&rdquo; he said,<br />&ldquo;On
his land he lived merrily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still in a study there as he stood,<br />He unbethought him of a
bill,<br />He unbethought him of a bill<br />Which his father had left
with him.</p>
<p>Bade him he should never on it looke<br />Till he was in extreame
neede,<br />&ldquo;And by my faith,&rdquo; said the heire of Lynne,<br />&ldquo;Then
now I had never more neede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tooke the bill and looked it on,<br />Good comfort that he found
there;<br />It told him of a castle wall<br />Where there stood three
chests in feare:</p>
<p>Two were full of the beaten gold,<br />The third was full of white
money.<br />He turned then downe his bags of bread<br />And filled them
full of gold so red.</p>
<p>Then he did never cease nor blinne<br />Till John of the Scales house
he did winne.<br />When that he came John of the Scales,<br />Up at
the speere he looked then;</p>
<p>There sate three lords upon a rowe,<br />And John o&rsquo; the Scales
sate at the bord&rsquo;s head,<br />And John o&rsquo; the Scales sate

<p>And then bespake the heire of Lynne<br />To John o&rsquo; the Scales
wife thus sayd hee,<br />Sayd &ldquo;Dame, wilt thou not trust me one
shott<br />That I may sit downe in this company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Christ&rsquo;s curse on my head,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;If
I do trust thee one pennye,&rdquo;<br />Then bespake a good fellowe,<br />Which
sate by John o&rsquo; the Scales his knee,</p>
<p>Said &ldquo;have thou here, thou heire of Lynne,<br />Forty-pence
I will lend thee,&mdash;<br />Some time a good fellow thou hast beene<br />And
other forty if it need bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drunken wine that was so cleere,<br />And every man they made
merry,<br />And then bespake him John o&rsquo; the Scales<br />Unto
the Lord of Lynne said hee;</p>
<p>Said &ldquo;how doest thou heire of Lynne,<br />Since I did buy thy
lands of thee?<br />I will sell it to thee twenty better cheepe,<br />Nor
ever did I buy it of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I draw you to recorde, lords all:&rdquo;<br />With that he
cast him god&rsquo;s penny;<br />Then he tooke to his bags of bread,<br />And
they were full of the gold so red.</p>
<p>He told him the gold then over the borde<br />It wanted never a broad
pennye;<br />&ldquo;That gold is thine, the land is mine,<br />And the
heire of Lynne againe I will bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now well-a-day!&rdquo; said John o&rsquo; the Scales&rsquo;
wife,<br />&ldquo;Well-a-day, and woe is me!<br />Yesterday I was the
lady of Lynne,<br />And now I am but John o&rsquo; the Scales wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says &ldquo;have thou here, thou good fellow,<br />Forty pence thou
did lend me;<br />Forty pence thou did lend me,<br />And forty I will
give thee,<br />I&rsquo;ll make thee keeper of my forrest,<br />Both
of the wild deere and the tame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then bespake the heire of Lynne,<br />These were the words and
thus spake hee,<br />&ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s curse light upon my crowne<br />If
ere my land stand in any jeopardye!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Ballad: Gordon Of Brackley</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Down Deeside cam Inveraye<br />Whistlin&rsquo; and playing,<br />An&rsquo;
called loud at Brackley gate<br />Ere the day dawning&mdash;<br />&ldquo;Come,
Gordon of Brackley.<br />Proud Gordon, come down,<br />There&rsquo;s
a sword at your threshold<br />Mair sharp than your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise now, gay Gordon,&rdquo;<br />His lady &rsquo;gan cry,<br />&ldquo;Look,
here is bold Inveraye<br />Driving your kye.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;How
can I go, lady,<br />An&rsquo; win them again,<br />When I have but
ae sword,<br />And Inveraye ten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise up, my maidens,<br />Wi&rsquo; roke and wi&rsquo; fan,<br />How
blest had I been<br />Had I married a man!<br />Arise up, my maidens,<br />Tak&rsquo;
spear and tak&rsquo; sword,<br />Go milk the ewes, Gordon,<br />An&rsquo;
I will be lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gordon sprung up<br />Wi&rsquo; his helm on his head,<br />Laid
his hand on his sword,<br />An&rsquo; his thigh on his steed,<br />An&rsquo;
he stooped low, and said,<br />As he kissed his young dame,<br />&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a Gordon rides out<br />That will never ride hame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There rode with fierce Inveraye<br />Thirty and three,<br />But wi&rsquo;
Brackley were nane<br />But his brother and he;<br />Twa gallanter Gordons<br />Did
never blade draw,<br />But against three-and-thirty<br />Wae&rsquo;s
me! what are twa?</p>
<p>Wi&rsquo; sword and wi&rsquo; dagger<br />They rushed on him rude;<br />The
twa gallant Gordons<br />Lie bathed in their blude.<br />Frae the springs
o&rsquo; the Dee<br />To the mouth o&rsquo; the Tay,<br />The Gordons
mourn for him,<br />And curse Inveraye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O were ye at Brackley?<br />An&rsquo; what saw ye there?<br />Was
his young widow weeping<br />An&rsquo; tearing her hair?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I
looked in at Brackley,<br />I looked in, and oh!<br />There was mirth,
there was feasting,<br />But naething o&rsquo; woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rose bloomed the lady,<br />An&rsquo; blithe as a bride,<br />As
a bridegroom bold Inveraye<br />Smiled by her side.<br />Oh! she feasted
him there<br />As she ne&rsquo;er feasted lord,<br />While the blood
of her husband<br />Was moist on his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her chamber she kept him<br />Till morning grew gray,<br />Thro&rsquo;
the dark woods of Brackley<br />She shewed him the way.<br />&lsquo;Yon
wild hill,&rsquo; she said,<br />&lsquo;Where the sun&rsquo;s shining
on,<br />Is the hill of Glentanner,&mdash;<br />One kiss, and begone!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s grief in the cottage,<br />There&rsquo;s grief in the

<h2>Ballad: Auld Maitland</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There lived a king in southern land,<br />King Edward hight his name;<br />Unwordily
he wore the crown,<br />Till fifty years were gane.</p>
<p>He had a sister&rsquo;s son o&rsquo;s ain,<br />Was large of blood
and bane;<br />And afterward, when he came up,<br />Young Edward hight
his name.</p>
<p>One day he came before the king,<br />And kneel&rsquo;d low on his
knee:<br />&ldquo;A boon, a boon, my good uncle,<br />I crave to ask
of thee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;At our lang wars, in fair Scotland,<br />I fain ha&rsquo;e
wish&rsquo;d to be,<br />If fifteen hundred waled wight men<br />You&rsquo;ll
grant to ride with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shall ha&rsquo;e thae, thou shall ha&rsquo;e mae;<br />I
say it sickerlie;<br />And I myself, an auld gray man,<br />Array&rsquo;d
your host shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Edward rade, King Edward ran&mdash;<br />I wish him dool and
pyne!<br />Till he had fifteen hundred men<br />Assembled on the Tyne.</p>
<p>And thrice as many at Berwicke<br />Were all for battle bound,<br />[Who,
marching forth with false Dunbar,<br />A ready welcome found.]</p>
<p>They lighted on the banks of Tweed,<br />And blew their coals sae
het,<br />And fired the Merse and Teviotdale,<br />All in an evening
late.</p>
<p>As they fared up o&rsquo;er Lammermoor,<br />They burn&rsquo;d baith
up and down,<br />Until they came to a darksome house,<br />Some call
it Leader-Town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha hauds this house?&rdquo; young Edward cried,<br />&ldquo;Or
wha gi&rsquo;est o&rsquo;er to me?&rdquo;<br />A gray-hair&rsquo;d knight
set up his head,<br />And crackit right crousely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Scotland&rsquo;s king I haud my house;<br />He pays me
meat and fee;<br />And I will keep my gude auld house,<br />While my
house will keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laid their sowies to the wall,<br />With mony a heavy peal;<br />But
he threw o&rsquo;er to them agen<br />Baith pitch and tar barrel.</p>
<p>With springalds, stanes, and gads of airn,<br />Amang them fast he
threw;<br />Till mony of the Englishmen<br />About the wall he slew.</p>
<p>Full fifteen days that braid host lay,<br />Sieging Auld Maitland
keen;<br />Syne they ha&rsquo;e left him, hail and feir,<br />Within
his strength of stane.</p>
<p>Then fifteen barks, all gaily good,<br />Met them upon a day,<br />Which
they did lade with as much spoil<br />As they you&rsquo;d bear away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;England&rsquo;s our ain by heritage;<br />And what can us
withstand,<br />Now we ha&rsquo;e conquer&rsquo;d fair Scotland,<br />With
buckler, bow, and brand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they are on to the land of France,<br />Where auld king Edward
lay,<br />Burning baith castle, tower, and town,<br />That he met in
his way.</p>
<p>Until he came unto that town,<br />Which some call Billop-Grace:<br />There
were Auld Maitland&rsquo;s sons, all three,<br />Learning at school,
alas!</p>
<p>The eldest to the youngest said,<br />&ldquo;Oh, see ye what I see?<br />If
all be true yon standard says,<br />We&rsquo;re fatherless all three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Scotland&rsquo;s conquer&rsquo;d up and down;<br />Landmen
we&rsquo;ll never be!<br />Now, will you go, my brethren two,<br />And
try some jeopardy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they ha&rsquo;e saddled twa black horse,<br />Twa black horse
and a gray;<br />And they are on to king Edward&rsquo;s host,<br />Before
the dawn of day.</p>
<p>When they arrived before the host,<br />They hover&rsquo;d on the
lay:<br />&ldquo;Wilt thou lend me our king&rsquo;s standard,<br />To
bear a little way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where wast thou bred? where wast thou born?<br />Where, or
in what countrie?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;In north of England I was born;&rdquo;<br />(It
needed him to lee.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A knight me gat, a ladye bore,<br />I am a squire of high
renown;<br />I well may bear&rsquo;t to any king<br />That ever yet
wore crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ne&rsquo;er came of an Englishman,<br />Had sic an e&rsquo;e
or bree;<br />But thou art the likest Auld Maitland,<br />That ever
I did see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sic a gloom on ae browhead,<br />Grant I ne&rsquo;er see
again!<br />For mony of our men he slew,<br />And mony put to pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Maitland heard his father&rsquo;s name,<br />An angry man was
he;<br />Then, lifting up a gilt dagger,<br />Hung low down by his knee,</p>
<p>He stabb&rsquo;d the knight the standard bore,<br />He stabb&rsquo;d
him cruellie;<br />Then caught the standard by the neuk,<br />And fast
away rode he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, is&rsquo;t na time, brothers,&rdquo; he cried,<br />&ldquo;Now,
is&rsquo;t na time to flee?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Ay, by my sooth!&rdquo;
they baith replied,<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bear you companye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest turn&rsquo;d him in a path,<br />And drew a burnish&rsquo;d
brand,<br />And fifteen of the foremost slew,<br />Till back the lave
did stand.</p>
<p>He spurr&rsquo;d the gray into the path,<br />Till baith his sides
they bled:<br />&ldquo;Gray! thou maun carry me away,<br />Or my life
lies in wad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain lookit o&rsquo;er the wall,<br />About the break of day;<br />There
he beheld the three Scots lads<br />Pursued along the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up portcullize! down draw-brig!<br />My nephews are at
hand;<br />And they shall lodge with me to-night,<br />In spite of all
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whene&rsquo;er they came within the yate,<br />They thrust their
horse them frae,<br />And took three lang spears in their hands,<br />Saying&mdash;&ldquo;Here
shall come nae me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they shot out, and they shot in,<br />Till it was fairly day;<br />When
mony of the Englishmen<br />About the draw-brig lay.</p>
<p>Then they ha&rsquo;e yoked the carts and wains,<br />To ca&rsquo;
their dead away,<br />And shot auld dykes abune the lave,<br />In gutters
where they lay.</p>
<p>The king, at his pavilion door,<br />Was heard aloud to say:<br />&ldquo;Last
night, three of the lads of France<br />My standard stole away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a fause tale, disguised they came,<br />And with a fauser
trayne;<br />And to regain my gaye standard,<br />These men where all
down slayne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ill befits,&rdquo; the youngest said,<br />A crown&egrave;d
king to lee;<br />But, or that I taste meat and drink,<br />Reprov&egrave;d
shall he be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went before king Edward straight,<br />And kneel&rsquo;d low on
his knee:<br />&ldquo;I wou&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;e leave, my lord,&rdquo;
he said,<br />&ldquo;To speak a word with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king he turn&rsquo;d him round about,<br />And wistna what to
say:<br />Quo&rsquo; he, &ldquo;Man, thou&rsquo;s ha&rsquo;e leave to
speak,<br />Though thou should speak all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye said that three young lads of France<br />Your standard
stole away,<br />With a fause tale and fauser trayne,<br />And mony
men did slay;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are nane the lads of France,<br />Nor e&rsquo;er pretend
to be:<br />We are three lads of fair Scotland,&mdash;<br />Auld Maitland&rsquo;s
sons are we.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is there men in all your host<br />Daur fight us three
to three.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Now, by my sooth,&rdquo; young Edward said,<br />&ldquo;Weel
fitted ye shall be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piercy shall with the eldest fight,<br />And Ethert Lunn with
thee;<br />William of Lancaster the third,<br />And bring your fourth
to me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Piercy, aft the Scot<br />Has cower&rsquo;d beneath
thy hand;<br />For every drap of Maitland blood,<br />I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e
a rig of land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clanked Piercy o&rsquo;er the head<br />A deep wound and a sair,<br />Till
the best blood of his body<br />Came running down his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ve slayne ane; slay ye the twa;<br />And that&rsquo;s
gude companye;<br />And if the twa shou&rsquo;d slay ye baith,<br />Ye&rsquo;se
get nae help frae me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ethert Lunn, a baited bear,<br />Had many battles seen;<br />He
set the youngest wonder sair,<br />Till the eldest he grew keen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am nae king, nor nae sic thing:<br />My word it shanna stand!<br />For
Ethert shall a buffet bide,<br />Come he beneath my brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clankit Ethert o&rsquo;er the head<br />A deep wound and a sair,<br />Till
the best blood in his body<br />Came running o&rsquo;er his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ve slayne twa; slay ye the ane;<br />Isna that
gude companye?<br />And though the ane shou&rsquo;d slay ye baith.<br />Ye&rsquo;se
get nae help of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twa-some they ha&rsquo;e slayne the ane,<br />They maul&rsquo;d
him cruellie;<br />Then hung him over the draw-brig,<br />That all the
host might see.</p>
<p>They rade their horse, they ran their horse,<br />Then hover&rsquo;d
on the lee:<br />&ldquo;We be three lads of fair Scotland,<br />That
fain wou&rsquo;d fighting see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This boasting when young Edward heard,<br />An angry man was he:<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take yon lad, I&rsquo;ll bind yon lad,<br />And bring him bound to thee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, God forbid,&rdquo; king Edward said,<br />&ldquo;That
ever thou shou&rsquo;d try!<br />Three worthy leaders we ha&rsquo;e
lost,<br />And thou the forth wou&rsquo;d lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou shou&rsquo;dst hang on yon draw-brig,<br />Blythe
wou&rsquo;d I never be.&rdquo;<br />But, with the poll-axe in his hand,<br />Upon
the brig sprang be.</p>
<p>The first stroke that young Edward ga&rsquo;e,<br />He struck with
might and main;<br />He clove the Maitland&rsquo;s helmet stout,<br />And
bit right nigh the brain.</p>
<p>When Maitland saw his ain blood fall,<br />An angry man was he;<br />He
let his weapon frae him fall,<br />And at his throat did flee.</p>
<p>And thrice about he did him swing,<br />Till on the ground he light,<br />Where
he has halden young Edward,<br />Tho&rsquo; he was great in might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let him up,&rdquo; king Edward cried,<br />&ldquo;And
let him come to me;<br />And for the deed that thou hast done,<br />Thou
shalt ha&rsquo;e earldomes three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er be said in France, nor e&rsquo;er<br />In
Scotland, when I&rsquo;m hame,<br />That Edward once lay under me,<br />And
e&rsquo;er gat up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pierced him through and through the heart,<br />He maul&rsquo;d
him cruellie;<br />Then hung him o&rsquo;er the draw-brig,<br />Beside
the other three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take frae me that feather-bed,<br />Make me a bed of strae!<br />I
wish I hadna lived this day,<br />To make my heart sae wae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were ance at London Tow&rsquo;r,<br />Where I was wont

<h2>Ballad: Robin Hood And The Butcher</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Come, all you brave gallants, and listen awhile,<br /><i>With hey
down, down, an a down</i>,<br />That are in the bowers within;<br />For
of Robin Hood, that archer good,<br />A song I intend for to sing.</p>
<p>Upon a time it chanc&egrave;d so,<br />Bold Robin in forrest did
&rsquo;spy<br />A jolly butcher, with a bonny fine mare,<br />With his
flesh to the market did hye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morrow, good fellow,&rdquo; said jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;What
food hast [thou]? tell unto me;<br />Thy trade to me tell, and where
thou dost dwell,<br />For I like well thy company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butcher he answer&rsquo;d jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;No matter
where I dwell;<br />For a butcher I am, and to Nottingham<br />I am
going, my flesh to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s [the] price of thy flesh?&rdquo; said jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;Come,
tell it soon unto me;<br />And the price of thy mare, be she never so
dear,<br />For a butcher fain would I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of my flesh,&rdquo; the butcher repli&rsquo;d,<br />&ldquo;I
soon will tell unto thee;<br />With my bonny mare, and they are not
too dear,<br />Four mark thou must give unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four mark I will give thee,&rdquo; saith jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;Four
mark it shall be thy fee;<br />The mony come count, and let me mount,<br />For
a butcher I fain would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Robin he is to Nottingham gone,<br />His butchers trade to begin;<br />With
good intent to the sheriff he went,<br />And there he took up his inn.</p>
<p>When other butchers did open their meat,<br />Bold Robin he then
begun;<br />But how for to sell he knew not well,<br />For a butcher
he was but young.</p>
<p>When other butchers no meat could sell,<br />Robin got both gold
and fee;<br />For he sold more meat for one peny<br />Then others could
do for three.</p>
<p>But when he sold his meat so fast,<br />No butcher by him could thrive;<br />For
he sold more meat for one peny<br />Than others could do for five.</p>
<p>Which made the butchers of Nottingham<br />To study as they did stand,<br />Saying,
&ldquo;Surely he &lsquo;is&rsquo; some prodigal,<br />That hath sold
his fathers land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butchers stepped to jolly Robin,<br />Acquainted with him for
to be;<br />&ldquo;Come, brother,&rdquo; one said, &ldquo;we be all
of one trade,<br />Come, will you go dine with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accurst of his heart,&rdquo; said jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;That
a butcher doth deny;<br />I will go with you, my brethren true,<br />As
fast as I can hie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when to the sheriffs house they came,<br />To dinner they hied
apace,<br />And Robin Hood he the man must be<br />Before them all to
say grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray God bless us all,&rdquo; said jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;And
our meat within this place;<br />A cup of sack so good will nourish
our blood,<br />And so do I end my grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come fill us more wine,&rdquo; said jolly Robin,<br />&ldquo;Let
us be merry while we do stay;<br />For wine and good cheer, be it never
so dear,<br />I vow I the reck&rsquo;ning will pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, &lsquo;brothers,&rsquo; be merry,&rdquo; said jolly
Robin,<br />&ldquo;Let us drink, and never give ore;<br />For the shot
I will pay, ere I go my way,<br />If it cost me five pounds and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a mad blade,&rdquo; the butchers then said;<br />Saies
the sheriff, &ldquo;He is some prodig&agrave;l,<br />That some land
has sold for silver and gold,<br />And now he doth mean to spend all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou any horn beasts,&rdquo; the sheriff repli&rsquo;d,<br />&ldquo;Good
fellow, to sell unto me?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes, that I have, good master
sheriff,<br />I have hundreds two or three;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a hundred aker of good free land,<br />If you please it
to see:<br />And Ile make you as good assurance of it,<br />As ever
my father made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff he saddled his good palfr&egrave;y,<br />And, with three
hundred pound in gold,<br />Away he went with bold Robin Hood,<br />His
horned beasts to behold.</p>
<p>Away then the sheriff and Robin did ride,<br />To the forrest of
merry Sherwood;<br />Then the sheriff did say, &ldquo;God bless us this
day<br />From a man they call Robin Hood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when a little farther they came,<br />Bold Robin he chanc&egrave;d
to spy<br />A hundred head of good red deer,<br />Come tripping the
sheriff full nigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like you my horn&rsquo;d beasts, good master sheriff?<br />They
be fat and fair for to see;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I tell thee, good fellow,
I would I were gone,<br />For I like not thy company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,<br />And blew but blasts three;<br />Then
quickly anon there came Little John,<br />And all his company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your will, master?&rdquo; then said Little John,<br />&ldquo;Good
master come tell unto me;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I have brought hither the
sheriff of Nottingham<br />This day to dine with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is welcome to me,&rdquo; then said Little John,<br />&ldquo;I
hope he will honestly pay;<br />I know he has gold, if it be but well
told,<br />Will serve us to drink a whole day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Robin took his mantle from his back,<br />And laid it upon the
ground:<br />And out of the sheriffs portmantle<br />He told three hundred
pound.</p>
<p>Then Robin he brought him thorow the wood,<br />And set him on his
dapple gray;<br />&ldquo;O have me commanded to your wife at home;&rdquo;<br />So
Robin went laughing away.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SIR PATRICK SPENS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Child finds the first published version of &ldquo;the grand old
ballad of Sir Patrick Spens,&rdquo; as Coleridge calls it, in Bishop
Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>.&nbsp; Here the name is &ldquo;Spence,&rdquo;
and the middle rhyme&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haf owre, haf owre to Aberdour,&rdquo;</p>
<p>is not of early date.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Cork-heeled Shoon,&rdquo;
too, cannot be early, but ballads are subject, in oral tradition, to
such modern interpolations.&nbsp; The verse about the ladies waiting
vainly is anticipated in a popular song of the fourteenth century, on
a defeat of the <i>noblesse</i> in Flanders&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their ladies them may abide in bower and hall well long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there be historical foundation for the ballad, it is probably
a blending of the voyage of Margaret, daughter of Alexander III., to
wed Eric, King of Norway, in 1281 (some of her escort were drowned on
their way home), with the rather mysterious death, or disappearance,
of Margaret&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;The Maid of Norway,&rdquo; on her
voyage to marry the son of Edward I., in 1290.&nbsp; A woman, who alleged
that she was the Maid of Norway, was later burned at the stake.&nbsp;
The great number and variety of versions sufficiently indicate the antiquity
of this ballad, wherein exact history is not to be expected.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF OTTERBURN</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>, Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s latest
edition of 1833: the copy in the edition of 1802 is less complete.&nbsp;
The gentle and joyous passage of arms here recorded, took place in August
1388.&nbsp; We have an admirable account of Otterburn fight from Froissart,
who revels in a gallant encounter, fairly fought out hand to hand, with
no intervention of archery or artillery, and for no wretched practical
purpose.&nbsp; In such a combat the Scots, never renowned for success
at long bowls, and led by a Douglas, were likely to prove victorious,
even against long odds, and when taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Choosing an advantage in the discordant days of Richard II., the
Scots mustered a very large force near Jedburgh, merely to break lances
on English ground, and take loot.&nbsp; Learning that, as they advanced
by the Carlisle route, the English intended to invade Scotland by Berwick
and the east coast, the Scots sent three or four hundred men-at-arms,
with a few thousand mounted archers and pikemen, who should harry Northumberland
to the walls of Newcastle.&nbsp; These were led by James, Earl of Douglas,
March, and Murray.&nbsp; In a fight at Newcastle, Douglas took Harry
Percy&rsquo;s pennon, which Hotspur vowed to recover.&nbsp; The retreat
began, but the Scots waited at Otterburn, partly to besiege the castle,
partly to abide Hotspur&rsquo;s challenge.&nbsp; He made his attack
at moonlight, with overwhelming odds, but was hampered by a marsh, and
incommoded by a flank attach of the Scots.&nbsp; Then it came to who
would pound longest, with axe and sword.&nbsp; Douglas cut his way through
the English, axe in hand, and was overthrown, but his men protected
his body.&nbsp; The Sinclairs and Lindsay raised his banner, with his
cry; March and Dunbar came up; Hotspur was taken by Montgomery, and
the English were routed with heavy loss.&nbsp; Douglas was buried in
Melrose Abbey; very many years later the English defiled his grave,
but were punished at Ancram Moor.&nbsp; There is an English poem on
the fight of &ldquo;about 1550&rdquo;; it has many analogies with our
Scottish version, and, doubtless, ours descends from a ballad almost
contemporary.&nbsp; The ballad was a great favourite of Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
In a severe illness, thinking of Lockhart, not yet his son-in-law, he
quoted&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;My wound is deep, I fain would sleep,<br />Take thou the vanguard
of the three.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Child thinks the command to</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;yield to the bracken-bush&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>unmartial.&nbsp; This does not seem a strong objection, in Froissart&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; It is explained in an oral fragment&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;For there lies aneth yon bracken-bush<br />Wha aft has conquered
mair than thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Mr. Child also thinks that the &ldquo;dreamy dream&rdquo; may be
copied from Hume of Godscroft.&nbsp; It is at least as probable that
Godscroft borrowed from the ballad which he cites.&nbsp; The embroidered
gauntlet of the Percy is in the possession of Douglas of Cavers to this
day.</p>

and oral recitations, and contains feeble literary interpolations, not,
of course, by Sir Walter.&nbsp; <i>The Complaint of Scotland</i> (1549)
mentions the &ldquo;Tale of the Young Tamlene&rdquo; as then popular.&nbsp;
It is needless here to enter into the subject of Fairyland, and captures
of mortals by Fairies: the Editor has said his say in his edition of
Kirk&rsquo;s <i>Secret Commonwealth</i>.&nbsp; The Nereids, in Modern
Greece, practise fairy cantrips, and the same beliefs exist in Samoa
and New Caledonia.&nbsp; The metamorphoses are found in the <i>Odyssey</i>,
Book iv., in the winning of Thetis, the <i>Nereid, or Fairy Bride</i>,
by Peleus, in a modern Cretan fairy tale, and so on.&nbsp; There is
a similar incident in <i>Penda Baloa</i>, a Senegambian ballad (<i>Contes
Populaires de la S&eacute;n&eacute;gambie</i>, Berenger Ferand, Paris,
1885).&nbsp; The dipping of Tamlane has precedents in <i>Old Deccan
Days</i>, in a Hottentot tale by Bleek, and in <i>Les Deux Fr&egrave;res</i>,
the Egyptian story, translated by Maspero (the Editor has already given
these parallels in a note to <i>Border Ballads</i>, by Graham R. Thomson).&nbsp;
Mr. Child also cites Mannhardt, &ldquo;Wald und Feldkulte,&rdquo; ii.
64-70.&nbsp; Carterhaugh, the scene of the ballad, is at the junction
of Ettrick and Yarrow, between Bowhill and Philiphaugh.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THOMAS RYMER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>; the original was derived from
a lady living near Erceldoune (Earlston), and from Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s
MSS.&nbsp; That Thomas of Erceldoune had some popular fame as a rhymer
and soothsayer as early as 1320-1350, seems to be established.&nbsp;
As late as the Forty Five, nay, even as late as the expected Napoleonic
invasion, sayings attributed to Thomas were repeated with some measure
of belief.&nbsp; A real Thomas Rymer of Erceldoune witnessed an undated
deed of Peter de Haga, early in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; The de
Hagas, or Haigs of Bemersyde, were the subjects of the prophecy attributed
to Thomas,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Betide, betide, whate&rsquo;er betide,<br />There will aye
be a Haig in Bemersyde,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and a Haig still owns that ancient <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> on the Tweed,
which has a singular set of traditions.&nbsp; Learmont is usually given
as the Erceldoune family name; a branch of the family owned Dairsie
in Fifeshire, and were a kind of hereditary provosts of St. Andrews.&nbsp;
If Thomas did predict the death of Alexander III., or rather report
it by dint of clairvoyance, he must have lived till 1285.&nbsp; The
date of the poem on the Fairy Queen, attributed to Thomas, is uncertain,
the story itself is a variant of &ldquo;Ogier the Dane.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The scene is Huntly Bank, under Eildon Hill, and was part of the lands
acquired, at fantastic prices, by Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; His passion
for land was really part of his passion for collecting antiquities.&nbsp;
The theory of Fairyland here (as in many other Scottish legends and
witch trials) is borrowed from the Pre-Christian Hades, and the Fairy
Queen is a late refraction from Persephone.&nbsp; Not to eat, in the
realm of the dead, is a regular precept of savage belief, all the world
over.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Kirk&rsquo;s <i>Secret Commonwealth of Elves,
Fauns, and Fairies</i> may be consulted, or the Editor&rsquo;s <i>Perrault</i>,
p. xxxv. (Oxford, 1888).&nbsp; Of the later legends about Thomas, Scott
gives plenty, in <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The long ancient
romantic poem on the subject is probably the source of the ballad, though
a local ballad may have preceded the long poem.&nbsp; Scott named the
glen through which the Bogle Burn flows to Chiefswood, &ldquo;The Rhymer&rsquo;s
Glen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SIR HUGH</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The date of the Martyrdom of Hugh is attributed by Matthew Paris
to 1225.&nbsp; Chaucer puts a version in the mouth of his Prioress.&nbsp;
No doubt the story must have been a mere excuse for Jew-baiting.&nbsp;
In America the Jew becomes &ldquo;The Duke&rdquo; in a version picked
up by Mr. Newells, from the recitation of a street boy in New York.&nbsp;
The daughter of a Jew is not more likely than the daughter of a duke
to have been concerned in the cruel and blasphemous imitation of the
horrors attributed by Horace to the witch Canidia.&nbsp; But some such
survivals of pagan sorcery did exist in the Middle Ages, under the influence
of &ldquo;Satanism.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SON DAVIE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Motherwell&rsquo;s version.&nbsp; One of many ballads on fratricide,
instigated by the mother: or inquired into by her, as the case may be.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Edward&rdquo; is another example of this gloomy situation.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE WIFE OF USHER&rsquo;S WELL</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Here</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The cock doth craw, the day doth daw,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>having a middle rhyme, can scarcely be of extreme antiquity.&nbsp;
Probably, in the original poem, the dead return to rebuke the extreme
grief of the Mother, but the poem is perhaps really more affecting in
the absence of a didactic motive.&nbsp; Scott obtained it from an old
woman in West Lothian.&nbsp; Probably the reading &ldquo;fashes,&rdquo;
(troubles), &ldquo;in the flood&rdquo; is correct, not &ldquo;fishes,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;freshes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mother desires that the sea may
never cease to be troubled till her sons return (verse 4, line 2).&nbsp;
The peculiar doom of women dead in child-bearing occurs even in Aztec
mythology.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE TWA CORBIES</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From the third volume of <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, derived by Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe from a traditional version.&nbsp; The English version,
&ldquo;Three Ravens,&rdquo; was published in <i>Melismata</i>, by T.
Ravensworth (1611).&nbsp; In Scots, the lady &ldquo;has ta&rsquo;en
another mate&rdquo; his hawk and hound have deserted the dead knight.&nbsp;
In the English song, the hounds watch by him, the hawks keep off carrion
birds, as for the lady&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;She buried him before the prime,<br />She was dead herselfe
ere evensong time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Probably the English is the earlier version.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BONNIE EARL OF MURRAY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Huntly had a commission to apprehend the Earl, who was in the disgrace
of James VI.&nbsp; Huntly, as an ally of Bothwell, asked him to surrender
at Donibristle, in Fife; he would not yield to his private enemy, the
house was burned, and Murray was slain, Huntly gashing his face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have spoiled a better face than your own,&rdquo; said the
dying Earl (1592).&nbsp; James Melville mentions contemporary ballads
on the murder.&nbsp; Ramsay published the ballad in his <i>Tea Table
Miscellany</i>, and it is often sung to this day.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>CLERK SAUNDERS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>First known as published in <i>Border Minstrelsy</i> (1802).&nbsp;
The apparition of the lover is borrowed from &ldquo;Sweet Willie&rsquo;s
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The evasions practised by the lady, and the austerities
vowed by her have many Norse, French, and Spanish parallels in folk-poetry.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s version is &ldquo;made up&rdquo; from several sources,
but is, in any case, verse most satisfactory as poetry.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>WALY, WALY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>, a curiously composite
gathering of verses.&nbsp; There is a verse, obviously a variant, in
a sixteenth century song, cited by Leyden.&nbsp; St. Anthon&rsquo;s
Well is on a hill slope of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, near Holyrood.&nbsp;
Here Jeanie Deans trysted with her sister&rsquo;s seducer, in <i>The
Heart of Midlothian</i>.&nbsp; The Cairn of Nichol Mushat, the wife-murderer,
is not far off.&nbsp; The ruins of Anthony&rsquo;s Chapel are still
extant.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>LOVE GREGOR</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There are French and Romaic variants of this ballad.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lochroyal,&rdquo;
where the ballad is localized, is in Wigtownshire, but the localization
varies.&nbsp; The &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; are as old as the Return of Odysseus,
in the <i>Odyssey</i>: his token is the singular construction of his
bridal bed, attached by him to a living tree-trunk.&nbsp; A similar
legend occurs in Chinese.&nbsp; See Gerland&rsquo;s <i>Alt-Giechische
M&auml;rchen</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE QUEEN&rsquo;S MARIE&mdash;MARY HAMILTON</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A made-up copy from Scott&rsquo;s edition of 1833.&nbsp; This ballad
has caused a great deal of controversy.&nbsp; Queen Mary had no Mary
Hamilton among her Four Maries.&nbsp; No Marie was executed for child-murder.&nbsp;
But we know, from Knox, that ballads were recited against the Maries,
and that one of the Mary&rsquo;s chamberwomen was hanged, with her lover,
a pottinger, or apothecary, for getting rid of her infant.&nbsp; These
last facts were certainly quite basis enough for a ballad, the ballad
echoing, not history, but rumour, and rumour adapted to the popular
taste.&nbsp; Thus the ballad might have passed unchallenged, as a survival,
more or less modified in time, of Queen Mary&rsquo;s period.&nbsp; But
in 1719 a Mary Hamilton, a Maid of Honour, of Scottish descent, was
executed in Russia, for infanticide.&nbsp; Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe
conceived that this affair was the origin of the ballad, and is followed
by Mr. Child.</p>
<p>We reply (1) The ballad has almost the largest number of variants
on record.&nbsp; This is a proof of antiquity.&nbsp; Variants so many,
differing in all sorts of points, could not have arisen between 1719,
and the age of Burns, who quotes the poem.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; This is especially improbable, because, in 1719, the old
vein of ballad poetry had run dry, popular song had chosen other forms,
and no literary imitator could have written Mary Hamilton in 1719.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; There is no example of a popular ballad in which a contemporary
event, interesting just because it is contemporary, is thrown back into
a remote age.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; The name, Mary Hamilton, is often <i>not</i> given to the
heroine in variants of the ballad.&nbsp; She is of several names and
ranks in the variants.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; As Mr. Child himself remarked, the &ldquo;pottinger&rdquo;
of the real story of Queen Mary&rsquo;s time occurs in one variant.&nbsp;
There was no &ldquo;pottinger&rdquo; in the Russian affair.</p>
<p>All these arguments, to which others might be added, seem fatal to
the late date and modern origin of the ballad, and Mr. Child&rsquo;s
own faith in the hypothesis was shaken, if not overthrown.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>KINMONT WILLIE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The account in Satchells
has either been based on the ballad, or the ballad is based on Satchells.&nbsp;
After a meeting, on the Border of Salkeld of Corby, and Scott of Haining,
Kinmont Willie was seized by the English as he rode home from the tryst.&nbsp;
Being &ldquo;wanted,&rdquo; he was lodged in Carlisle Castle, and this
was a breach of the day&rsquo;s truce.&nbsp; Buccleugh, as warder, tried
to obtain Willie&rsquo;s release by peaceful means.&nbsp; These failing,
Buccleugh did what the ballad reports, April 13, 1596.&nbsp; Harden
and Goudilands were with Buccleugh, being his neighbours near Branxholme.&nbsp;
Dicky of Dryhope, with others, Armstrongs, was also true to the call
of duty.&nbsp; A few verses in the ballad are clearly by <i>aut</i>
<i>Gualterus aut diabolus</i>, and none the worse for that.&nbsp; Salkeld,
of course, was not really slain; and, if the men were &ldquo;left for
dead,&rdquo; probably they were not long in that debatable condition.&nbsp;
In the rising of 1745 Prince Charlie&rsquo;s men forded Eden as boldly
as Buccleuch, the Prince saving a drowning Highlander with his own hand.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>JAMIE TELFER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Scott, for once, was wrong in his localities.&nbsp; The Dodhead of
the poem is <i>not</i> that near Singlee, in Ettrick, but a place of
the same name, near Skelfhill, on the southern side of Teviot, within
three miles of Stobs, where Telfer vainly seeks help from Elliot.&nbsp;
The other Dodhead is at a great distance from Stobs, up Borthwick Water,
over the tableland, past Clearburn Loch and Buccleugh, and so down Ettrick,
past Tushielaw.&nbsp; The Catslockhill is not that on Yarrow, near Ladhope,
but another near Branxholme, whence it is no far cry to Branxholme Hall.&nbsp;
Borthwick Water, Goudilands (below Branxholme), Commonside (a little
farther up Teviot), Allanhaugh, and the other places of the Scotts,
were all easily &ldquo;warned.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are traces of a modern
hand in this excellent ballad.&nbsp; The topography is here corrected
from MS. notes in a first edition of the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, in the library
of Mr. Charles Grieve at Branxholme&rsquo; Park, a scion of &ldquo;auld
Jock Grieve&rdquo; of the Coultart Cleugh.&nbsp; Names linger long in
pleasant Teviotdale.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE DOUGLAS TRAGEDY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The ballad has Norse analogues, but is here localized on the Douglas
Burn, a tributary of Yarrow on the left bank.&nbsp; The St. Mary&rsquo;s
Kirk would be that now ruinous, on St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch, the chapel
burned by the Lady of Branxholme when she</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;gathered a band<br />Of the best that would ride at her command,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>in the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>.&nbsp; The ancient keep of
Blackhouse on Douglas Burn may have been the home of the heroine, if
we are to localize.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BONNY HIND</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Herd got this tragic ballad from a milkmaid, in 1771.&nbsp; Mr. Child
quotes a verse parallel, preserved in Faroe, and in the Icelandic.&nbsp;
There is a similar incident in the cycle of Kullervo, in the Finnish
<i>Kalevala</i>.&nbsp; Scott says that similar tragedies are common
in Scotch popular poetry; such cases are &ldquo;Lizzie Wan,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Dochter, Lady Jean.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sorrow nearly
as bitter occurs in the French &ldquo;Milk White Dove&rdquo;: a brother
kills his sister, metamorphosed into a white deer.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Bridge of Death&rdquo; (French) seems to hint at something of the same
kind; or rather the Editor finds that he has arbitrarily read &ldquo;The
Bonny Hind&rdquo; into &ldquo;Le Pont des Morts,&rdquo; in Puymaigre&rsquo;s
<i>Chants Populaires du Pays</i> <i>Messin</i>, p. 60.&nbsp; (<i>Ballads
and Lyrics of Old France</i>, p. 63)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>YOUNG BEICHAN, OR YOUNG BICHAM</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This is the original of the Cockney <i>Loving Ballad of Lord Bateman</i>,
illustrated by Cruikshank, and by Thackeray.&nbsp; There is a vast number
of variants, evidence to the antiquity of the story.&nbsp; The earliest
known trace is in the familiar legend of the Saracen lady, who sought
and found her lover, Gilbert Becket, father of Thomas &agrave; Becket,
in London (see preface to <i>Life of Becket</i>, or Beket), Percy Society,
1845.&nbsp; The date may be <i>circ</i>. 1300.&nbsp; The kind of story,
the loving daughter of the cruel captor, is as old as Medea and Jason,
and her search for her lover comes in such <i>M&auml;rchen</i> as &ldquo;The
Black Bull o&rsquo; Norraway.&rdquo;&nbsp; No story is more widely diffused
(see <i>A Far Travelled Tale</i>, in the Editor&rsquo;s <i>Custom and
Myth</i>).&nbsp; The appearance of the &ldquo;True Love,&rdquo; just
at her lover&rsquo;s wedding, is common in the <i>M&auml;rchen</i> of
the world, and occurs in a Romaic ballad, as well as in many from Northern
Europe.&nbsp; The &ldquo;local colour&rdquo;&mdash;the Moor or Saracen&mdash;is
derived from Crusading times, perhaps.&nbsp; Motherwell found the ballad
recited with intervals of prose narrative, as in <i>Aucassin and Nicolette</i>.&nbsp;
The notes to Cruikshank&rsquo;s <i>Loving Ballad</i> are, obviously,
by Thackeray.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BONNY HOUSE O&rsquo; AIRLY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Lord Airly&rsquo;s houses were destroyed by Argyll, representing
the Covenanters, and also in pursuance of a private feud, in 1639, or
1640.&nbsp; There are erroneous versions of this ballad, in which Lochiel
appears, and the date is, apparently, transferred to 1745.&nbsp; Montrose,
in his early Covenanting days, was not actually concerned in the burning
of the Bonnie House, which he, when a Royalist, revenged on the possessions
of &ldquo;gleyed Argyll.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reference to &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo;
is out of keeping; no one, perhaps, ever called Charles I. by that affectionate
name.&nbsp; Lady Ogilvie had not the large family attributed to her:
her son, Lord Ogilvie, escaped from prison in the Castle of St. Andrews,
after Philiphaugh.&nbsp; A Lord Ogilvie was out in 1745; and, later,
had a regiment in the French Service.&nbsp; Few families have a record
so consistently loyal.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROB ROY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The abductors of the widowed young heiress of Edenhelly were Rob&rsquo;s
sons, Robin Oig, who went through a form of marriage with the girl,
and James Mohr, a good soldier, but a double-dyed spy and scoundrel.&nbsp;
Robin Oig was hanged in 1753.&nbsp; James Mohr, a detected traitor to
Prince Charles, died miserably in Paris, in 1754.&nbsp; Readers of Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Catriona</i> know James well; information as to
his villanies is extant in Additional MSS. (British Museum).&nbsp; This
is probably the latest ballad in the collection.&nbsp; It occurs in
several variants, some of which, copied out by Burns, derive thence
a certain accidental interest.&nbsp; In Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Catriona</i>,
the heroine of that name takes a thoroughly Highland view of the abduction.&nbsp;
Robin Oig, in any case, was &ldquo;nane the waur o&rsquo; a hanging,&rdquo;
for he shot a Maclaren at the plough-tail, before the Forty-Five.&nbsp;
The trial of these sons of Alpen was published shortly after Scott&rsquo;s
<i>Rob Roy</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>KILLIECRANKIE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Fought on July 27, 1689.&nbsp; <i>Not</i> on the haugh near the modern
road by the railway, but higher up the hill, in the grounds of Urrard
House.&nbsp; Two shelter trenches, whence Dundee&rsquo;s men charged,
are still visible, high on the hillside above Urrand.&nbsp; There is
said, by Mr. Child, to have been a contemporary broadside of the ballad,
which is an example of the evolution of popular ballads from the old
traditional model.&nbsp; There is another song, by, or attributed to,
Burns, and of remarkable spirit and vigour.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ANNAN WATER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i> Scott says that these are the original
words of the tune of &ldquo;Allan Water,&rdquo; and that he has added
two verses from a variant with a fortunate conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allan
Water&rdquo; is a common river name; the stream so called joins Teviot
above Branxholme.&nbsp; Annan is the large stream that flows into the
Solway Frith.&nbsp; The Gate-slack, in Annandale, fixes the locality.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE ELPHIN NOURRICE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This curious poem is taken from the reprint of Charles Kirkpatrick
Sharpe&rsquo;s tiny <i>Ballad Book</i>, itself now almost <i>introuvable</i>.&nbsp;
It does not, to the Editor&rsquo;s knowledge, occur elsewhere, but is
probably authentic.&nbsp; The view of the Faery Queen is more pleasing
and sympathetic than usual.&nbsp; Why mortal women were desired as nurses
(except to attend on stolen mortal children, kept to &ldquo;pay the
Kane to hell&rdquo;) is not obvious.&nbsp; Irish beliefs are precisely
similar; in England they are of frequent occurrence.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>JOHNNIE ARMSTRANG</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Armstrang of Gilnockie was a brother of the laird of Mangertoun.&nbsp;
He had a kind of Robin Hood reputation on the Scottish Border, as one
who only robbed the English.&nbsp; Pitscottie&rsquo;s account of his
slaying by James V. (1529) reads as if the ballad were his authority,
and an air for the subject is mentioned in the <i>Complaint of Scotland</i>.&nbsp;
In Sir Herbert Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>History of Dumfries and Galloway</i>
is an excellent account of the historical facts of the case.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>EDOM O&rsquo; GORDON</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Founded on an event in the wars between Kingsmen and Queensmen, in
the minority of James VI., while Queen Mary was imprisoned in England.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Edom&rdquo; was Adam Gordon of Auchindown, brother of Huntley,
and a Queen&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; He, by his retainer, Car, or Ker, burned
Towie House, a seat of the Forbes&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ker recurs in the long
and more or less literary ballad of <i>The Battle of Balrinnes</i>.&nbsp;
In variants the localities are much altered, and, in one version, the
scene is transferred to Ayrshire, and Loudoun Castle.&nbsp; All the
ballads of fire-raising, a very usual practice, have points in common,
and transference was easy.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>LADY ANNE BOTHWELL&rsquo;S LAMENT</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Tradition has confused the heroine of this piece with the wife of
Bothwelhaugh, who slew the Regent Murray.&nbsp; That his motive was
not mere political assassination, but to avenge the ill-treatment and
death of his wife, seems to be disproved by Maidment.&nbsp; The affair,
however, is still obscure.&nbsp; This deserted Lady Anne of the ballad
was, in fact, not the wife of Bothwelhaugh, but the daughter of the
Bishop of Orkney; her lover is said to have been her cousin, Alexander
Erskine, son of the Earl of Mar.&nbsp; Part of the poem (Mr. Child points
out) occurs in Broome&rsquo;s play, <i>The Northern Lass</i> (1632).&nbsp;
Though a popular favourite, the piece is clearly of literary origin,
and has been severely &ldquo;edited&rdquo; by a literary hand.&nbsp;
This version is Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>JOCK O&rsquo; THE SIDE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A Liddesdale chant.&nbsp; Jock flourished about 1550-1570, and is
commemorated as a receiver by Sir Richard Maitland in a poem often quoted.&nbsp;
The analogies of this ballad with that of &ldquo;Kinmont Willie&rdquo;
are very close.&nbsp; The reference to a punch-bowl sounds modern, and
the tale is much less plausible than that of &ldquo;Kinmont Willie,&rdquo;
which, however, bears a few obvious marks of Sir Walter&rsquo;s own
hand.&nbsp; A sceptical editor must choose between two theories: either
Scott of Satchells founded his account of the affair of &ldquo;Kinmont
Willie&rdquo; on a pre-existing ballad of that name, or the ballad printed
by Scott is based on the prose narrative of Scott of Satchells.&nbsp;
The former hypothesis, everything considered, is the more probable.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ANNET</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Published in Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>, from a Scotch manuscript,
&ldquo;with some corrections.&rdquo;&nbsp; The situation, with various
differences in detail and conclusion, is popular in Norse and Romaic
ballads, and also in many <i>M&auml;rchen</i> of the type of <i>The
Black Bull of Norraway</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>FAIR ANNIE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; There are Danish, Swedish,
Dutch, and German versions, and the theme enters artistic poetry as
early as Marie de France (<i>Le Lai del Freisne</i>).&nbsp; In Scotch
the Earl of Wemyss is a recent importation: the earldom dates from 1633.&nbsp;
Of course this process of attaching a legend or <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
to a well-known name, or place, is one of the most common in mythological
evolution, and by itself invalidates the theory which would explain
myths by a philological analysis of the proper names in the tale.&nbsp;
These may not be, and probably are not, the original names.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE DOWNIE DENS OF YARROW</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; Scott thought that the hero
was Walter Scott, third son of Thirlestane, slain by Scott of Tushielaw.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;monument&rdquo; (a standing stone near Yarrow) is really
of a very early, rather Post-Roman date, and refers to no feud of Thirlestane,
Oakwood, Kirkhope, or Tushielaw.&nbsp; The stone is not far from Yarrow
Krik, near a place called Warrior&rsquo;s Rest.&nbsp; Hamilton of Bangour&rsquo;s
version is beautiful and well known.&nbsp; Quite recently a very early
interment of a corpse, in the curved position, was discovered not far
from the standing stone with the inscription.&nbsp; Ballad, stone, and
interment may all be distinct and separate.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>SIR ROLAND</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Motherwell&rsquo;s <i>Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The authenticity
of the ballad is dubious, but, if a forgery, it is a very skilled one
for the early nineteenth century.&nbsp; Poets like Mr. Swinburne, Mr.
Rossetti, and Mrs. Marriot Watson have imitated the genuine popular
ballad, but never so closely as the author of &ldquo;Sir Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROSE THE RED AND WHITE LILY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From the Jamieson-Brown MS., originally written out by Mrs. Brown
in 1783: Sir Waiter made changes in <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp;
The ballad is clearly a composite affair.&nbsp; Robert Chambers regarded
Mrs. Brown as the Mrs. Harris of ballad lore, but Mr. Norval Clyne&rsquo;s
reply was absolutely crushing and satisfactory.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF HARLAW</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Fought on July 24, 1411.&nbsp; This fight broke the Highland force
in Scotland.&nbsp; The first version is, of course, literary, perhaps
a composition of 1550, or even earlier.&nbsp; The second version is
traditional, and was procured by Aytoun from Lady John Scott, herself
the author of some beautiful songs.&nbsp; But the best ballad on the
Red Harlaw is that placed by Scott in the mouth of Elspeth, in <i>The
Antiquary</i>.&nbsp; This, indeed, is beyond all rivalry the most splendid
modern imitation of the ancient popular Muse.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>DICKIE MACPHALION</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A great favourite of Scott&rsquo;s, who heard it sung at Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s,
during his tour in Ireland (1825).&nbsp; One verse recurs in a Jacobite
chant, probably of 1745-1760, but the bibliography of Jacobite songs
is especially obscure.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>A LYKE-WAKE DIRGE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; The ideas are mainly pre-Christian;
the Brig o&rsquo; Dread occurs in Islamite and Iroquois belief, and
in almost all mythologies the souls have to cross a River.&nbsp; Music
for this dirge is given in Mr. Harold Boulton&rsquo;s and Miss Macleod&rsquo;s
<i>Songs of the North</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE LAIRD OF WARISTOUN</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This version was taken down by Sir Walter Scott from his mother&rsquo;s
recitation, for Jamieson&rsquo;s book of ballads.&nbsp; Jamieson later
quarrelled bitterly with Sir Walter, as letters at Abbotsford prove.&nbsp;
A variant is given by Kinloch, and a longer, less poetical, but more
historically accurate version is given by Buchan.&nbsp; The House of
Waristoun is, or lately was, a melancholy place hanging above a narrow
lake, in the northern suburbs of Edinburgh, near the Water of Leith.&nbsp;
Kincaid was the name of the Laird; according to Chambers, the more famous
lairds of Covenanting times were Johnstons.&nbsp; Kincaid is said to
have treated his wife cruelly, wherefore she, or her nurse, engaged
one Robert Weir, an old servant of her father (Livingstone of Dunipace),
to strangle the unhappy man in his own bedroom (July 2, 1600).&nbsp;
The lady was beheaded, the nurse was burned, and, later, Weir was also
executed.&nbsp; The line</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that ye may sink for sin&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>occurs in an earlier ballad on Edinburgh Castle&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;And that all for the black dinner<br />Earl Douglas got therein.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>MAY COLVEN</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Herd&rsquo;s MS.&nbsp; Versions occur in Polish, German, Magyar,
Portuguese, Scandinavian, and in French.&nbsp; The ballad is here localised
on the Carrick coast, near Girvan.&nbsp; The lady is called a Kennedy
of Culzean.&nbsp; Prof. Bugge regards this widely diffused ballad as
based on the Apocryphal legend of Judith and Holofernes.&nbsp; If so,
the legend is <i>diablement chang&eacute; en route</i>.&nbsp; More probably
the origin is a <i>M&auml;rchen</i> of a kind of <i>Rakshasa</i> fatal
to women.&nbsp; Mr. Child has collected a vast mass of erudition on
the subject, and by no means acquiesces in Prof. Bugge&rsquo;s ingenious
hypothesis.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>JOHNIE FAA</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Pinkerton&rsquo;s Scottish Ballads.&nbsp; The event narrated
is a legend of the house of Cassilis (Kennedy), but is wholly unhistorical.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir John Faa,&rdquo; in the fable, is aided by Gypsies, but,
apparently, is not one of the Earls of Egypt, on whom Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s
novel, <i>The Raiders</i>, may be consulted.&nbsp; The ballad was first
printed, as far as is known, in Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>HOBBIE NOBLE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The hero recurs in <i>Jock o&rsquo; the Side</i>, and Jock o&rsquo;
the Mains is an historical character, that is, finds mention in authentic
records, as Scott points out.&nbsp; The Armstrongs were deported in
great numbers, as &ldquo;an ill colony,&rdquo; to Ulster, by James I.&nbsp;
Sir Herbert Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>History of Dumfries and Galloway</i>
may be consulted for these and similar reivers.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE TWA SISTERS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>A version of &ldquo;Binnorie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ballad here ends abruptly;
doubtless the fiddler made fiddle-strings of the lady&rsquo;s hair,
and a fiddle of her breast-bone, while the instrument probably revealed
the cruelty of the sister.&nbsp; Other extant versions are composite
or interpolated, so this fragment (Sharpe&rsquo;s) has been preferred
in this place.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>MARY AMBREE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Taken by Percy from a piece in the Pepys Collection.&nbsp; The girl
warrior is a favourite figure in popular romance.&nbsp; Often she slays
a treacherous lover, as in <i>Billy Taylor</i>.&nbsp; Nothing is known
of Mary Ambree as an historical personage; she may be as legendary as
fair maiden Lilias, of Liliarid&rsquo;s Edge, who &ldquo;fought upon
her stumps.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that case the local name is demonstrably
earlier than the mythical Lilias, who fought with such tenacity.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ALISON GROSS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Jamieson gave this ballad from a manuscript, altering the spelling
in conformity with Scots orthography.&nbsp; Mr. Child prints the manuscript;
here Jamieson&rsquo;s more familiar spelling is retained.&nbsp; The
idea of the romance occurs in a Romaic <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, but, in
place of the Queen of Faery, a more beautiful girl than the sorceress
(Nereid in Romaic), restores the youth to his true shape.&nbsp; Mr.
Child regarded the tale as &ldquo;one of the numerous wild growths&rdquo;
from <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.&nbsp; It would be more correct to
say that <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> is a late, courtly, French adaptation
and amplification of the original popular &ldquo;wild growth&rdquo;
which first appears (in literary form) as <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, in
Apuleius.&nbsp; Except for the metamorphosis, however, there is little
analogy in this case.&nbsp; The friendly act of the Fairy Queen is without
parallel in British Folklore, but Mr. Child points out that the Nereid
Queen, in Greece, is still as kind as Thetis of old, not a sepulchral
siren, the shadow of the pagan &ldquo;Fairy Queen Proserpina,&rdquo;
as Campion calls her.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE HEIR OF LYNNE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Percy&rsquo;s Folio Manuscript.&nbsp; There is a cognate Greek
epigram&mdash;</p>
<p>&Chi;&rho;&upsilon;&sigma;&omicron;&nu; &alpha;&nu;&eta;&rho; &epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&omega;&nu;
&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&pi;&epsilon; &beta;&rho;&omicron;&chi;&omicron;&nu;

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>GORDON OF BRACKLEY</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This, though probably not the most authentic, is decidedly the most
pleasing version; it is from Mackay&rsquo;s collection, perhaps from
his pen.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>EDWARD</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Percy got this piece from Lord Hailes, with pseudo-antiquated spelling.&nbsp;
Mr. Swinburne has published a parallel ballad &ldquo;From the Finnish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are a number of parallel ballads on Cruel Brothers, and Cruel
Sisters, such as <i>Son Davie</i>, which may be compared.&nbsp; Fratricides
and unconscious incests were motives dear to popular poetry.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>YOUNG BENJIE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; That corpses <i>might</i>
begin to &ldquo;thraw,&rdquo; if carelessly watched, was a prevalent
superstition.&nbsp; Scott gives an example: the following may be added,
as less well known.&nbsp; The watchers had left the corpse alone, and
were dining in the adjoining room, when a terrible noise was heard in
the chamber of death.&nbsp; None dared enter; the minister was sent
for, and passed into the room.&nbsp; He emerged, asked for a pair of
tongs, and returned, bearing in the tongs <i>a bloody glove</i>, and
the noise ceased.&nbsp; He always declined to say what he had witnessed.&nbsp;
Ministers were exorcists in the last century, and the father of James
Thomson, the poet, died suddenly in an interview with a guest, in a
haunted house.&nbsp; The house was pulled down, as being uninhabitable.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>AULD MAITLAND</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From <i>The Border Minstrelsy</i>.&nbsp; This ballad is inserted,
not for its merit, still less for its authenticity, but for the problem
of its puzzling history.&nbsp; Scott certainly got it from the mother
of the Ettrick Shepherd, in 1801.&nbsp; The Shepherd&rsquo;s father
had been a grown-up man in 1745, and his mother was also of a great
age, and unlikely to be able to learn a new-forged ballad by heart.&nbsp;
The Shepherd himself (then a most unsophisticated person) said, in a
letter of June 30, 1801, that he was &ldquo;surprized to hear this song
is suspected by some to be a modern forgery; the contrary will be best
proved by most of the old people, here about, having a great part of
it by heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two last lines of verse seven were, confessedly,
added by Hogg, to fill a <i>lacuna</i>.&nbsp; They are especially modern
in style.&nbsp; Now thus to fill up sham <i>lacunae</i> in sham ballads
of his own, with lines manifestly modern, was a favourite trick of Surtees
of Mainsforth.&nbsp; He used the device in &ldquo;Barthram&rsquo;s Dirge,&rdquo;
which entirely took in Sir Walter, and was guilty of many other <i>supercheries</i>,
especially of the &ldquo;Fray of Suport Mill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Could the
unlettered Shepherd, fond of hoaxes as he was, have invented this stratagem,
sixteen years before he joined the <i>Blackwood</i> set?&nbsp; And is
it conceivable that his old mother, entering into the joke, would commit
her son&rsquo;s fraudulent verses to memory, and recite them to Sir
Walter as genuine tradition?&nbsp; She said to Scott, that the ballad
&ldquo;never was printed i&rsquo; the world, for my brothers and me
learned it and many mae frae auld Andrew Moore, and he learned it frae
auld Baby Mettlin&rdquo; (Maitland?) &ldquo;wha was housekeeper to the
first laird o&rsquo; Tushilaw.&rdquo;&nbsp; (On Ettrick, near Thirlestane.&nbsp;
She doubtless meant the first of the Andersons of Tushielaw, who succeeded
the old lairds, the Scotts.)&nbsp; &ldquo;She was said to hae been another
or a guid ane, and there are many queer stories about hersel&rsquo;,
but O, she had been a grand singer o&rsquo; auld songs an&rsquo; ballads.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Hogg&rsquo;s <i>Domestic Manners of Sir Walter Scott</i>, p. 61, 1834.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maitland upon auld beird gray&rdquo; is mentioned by Gawain
Douglas, in his <i>Palice of Honour</i>, which the Shepherd can hardly
have read, and Scott identified this Maitland with the ancestor of Lethington;
his date was 1250-1296.&nbsp; On the whole, even the astute Shepherd,
in his early days of authorship, could hardly have laid a plot so insidious,
and the question of the authenticity and origin of the ballad (obvious
interpolations apart) remains a mystery.&nbsp; Who could have forged
it?&nbsp; It is, as an exercise in imitation, far beyond <i>Hardyknute</i>,
and at least on a level with <i>Sir Roland</i>.&nbsp; The possibility
of such forgeries is now very slight indeed, but vitiates early collections.</p>
<p>If we suspect Leyden, who alone had the necessary knowledge of antiquities,
we are still met by the improbability of old Mrs. Hogg being engaged
in the hoax.&nbsp; Moreover, Leyden was probably too keen an antiquary
to take part in one of the deceptions which Ritson wished to punish
so severely.&nbsp; Mr. Child expresses his strong and natural suspicions
of the authenticity of the ballad, and Hogg is, certainly, a dubious
source.&nbsp; He took in Jeffrey with the song of &ldquo;Donald Macgillavray,&rdquo;
and instantly boasted of his triumph.&nbsp; He could not have kept his
secret, after the death of Scott.&nbsp; These considerations must not
be neglected, however suspicious &ldquo;Auld, Maitland&rdquo; may appear.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>THE BROOMFIELD HILL</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>From Buchan&rsquo;s <i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>.&nbsp;
There are Elizabethan references to the poem, and a twelfth century
romance turns on the main idea of sleep magically induced.&nbsp; The
lover therein is more fortunate than the hero of the ballad, and, finally,
overcomes the spell.&nbsp; The idea recurs in the Norse poetry.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>WILLIE&rsquo;S LADYE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Scott took this ballad from Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s celebrated Manuscript.&nbsp;
The kind of spell indicated was practised by Hera upon Alcmena, before
the birth of Heracles.&nbsp; Analogous is the spell by binding witch-knots,
practised by Simaetha on her lover, in the second Idyll of Theocritus.&nbsp;
Montaigne has some curious remarks on these enchantments, explaining
their power by what is now called &ldquo;suggestion.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is a Danish parallel to &ldquo;Willie&rsquo;s Ladye,&rdquo; translated
by Jamieson.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROBIN HOOD BALLADS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There is plentiful &ldquo;learning&rdquo; about Robin Hood, but no
real knowledge.&nbsp; He is first mentioned in literature, as the subject
of &ldquo;rhymes,&rdquo; in <i>Piers Plowman</i> (<i>circ</i>. 1377).&nbsp;
As a topic of ballads he must be much older than that date.&nbsp; In
1439 his name was a synonym for a bandit.&nbsp; Wyntoun, the Scots chronicler,
dates the outlaw in the time of Edward I.&nbsp; Major, the Scots philosopher
and master of John Knox, makes a guess (taken up by Scott in <i>Ivanhoe</i>)
as the period of Richard I.&nbsp; Kuhn seeks to show that Hood is a
survival of Woden, or of his <i>Wooden</i>, &ldquo;wooden horse&rdquo;
or hobby horse.&nbsp; The Robin Hood play was parallel with the May
games, which, as Mr. Frazer shows in his <i>Golden Bough</i>, were really
survivals of a world-wide religious practice.&nbsp; But Robin Hood need
not be confused with the legendary May King.&nbsp; Mr. Child judiciously
rejects these mythological conjectures, based, as they are, on far-fetched
etymologies and analogies.&nbsp; Robin is an idealized bandit, reiver,
or Klepht, as in modern Romaic ballads, and his adventures are precisely
such as popular fancy everywhere attaches to such popular heroes.&nbsp;
An historical Robin there may have been, but <i>premit nox alta</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROBIN HOOD AND THE MONK</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>This copy follows in Mr. Child&rsquo;s early edition, &ldquo;from
the second edition of Ritson&rsquo;s <i>Robin Hood</i>, as collated
by Sir Frederic Madden.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is conjectured to be &ldquo;possibly
as old as the reign of Edward II.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the murder of a
monk should be pardoned in the facile way described is manifestly improbable.&nbsp;
Even in the lawless Galloway of 1508, McGhie of Phumpton was fined six
merks for &ldquo;throwing William Schankis, monk, from his horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(History of Dumfries and Galloway, by Sir Herbert Maxwell, p. 155.)</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROBIN HOOD AND THE POTTER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Published by Ritson, from a Cambridge MS., probably of the reign
of Henry VII.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h3>ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Published by Ritson, from a Black Letter copy in the collection of
Anthony Wood, the Oxford antiquary.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
