<h2>STORY: THE RED ONE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>There it was!&nbsp; The abrupt liberation of sound!&nbsp; As he timed
it with his watch, Bassett likened it to the trump of an archangel.&nbsp;
Walls of cities, he meditated, might well fall down before so vast and
compelling a summons.&nbsp; For the thousandth time vainly he tried
to analyse the tone-quality of that enormous peal that dominated the
land far into the strong-holds of the surrounding tribes.&nbsp; The
mountain gorge which was its source rang to the rising tide of it until
it brimmed over and flooded earth and sky and air.&nbsp; With the wantonness
of a sick man&rsquo;s fancy, he likened it to the mighty cry of some
Titan of the Elder World vexed with misery or wrath.&nbsp; Higher and
higher it arose, challenging and demanding in such profounds of volume
that it seemed intended for ears beyond the narrow confines of the solar
system.&nbsp; There was in it, too, the clamour of protest in that there
were no ears to hear and comprehend its utterance.</p>
<p>- Such the sick man&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; Still he strove to analyse
the sound.&nbsp; Sonorous as thunder was it, mellow as a golden bell,
thin and sweet as a thrummed taut cord of silver - no; it was none of
these, nor a blend of these.&nbsp; There were no words nor semblances
in his vocabulary and experience with which to describe the totality
of that sound.</p>
<p>Time passed.&nbsp; Minutes merged into quarters of hours, and quarters
of hours into half-hours, and still the sound persisted, ever changing
from its initial vocal impulse yet never receiving fresh impulse - fading,
dimming, dying as enormously as it had sprung into being.&nbsp; It became
a confusion of troubled mutterings and babblings and colossal whisperings.&nbsp;
Slowly it withdrew, sob by sob, into whatever great bosom had birthed
it, until it whimpered deadly whispers of wrath and as equally seductive
whispers of delight, striving still to be heard, to convey some cosmic
secret, some understanding of infinite import and value.&nbsp; It dwindled
to a ghost of sound that had lost its menace and promise, and became
a thing that pulsed on in the sick man&rsquo;s consciousness for minutes
after it had ceased.&nbsp; When he could hear it no longer, Bassett
glanced at his watch.&nbsp; An hour had elapsed ere that archangel&rsquo;s
trump had subsided into tonal nothingness.</p>
<p>Was this, then, <i>his</i> dark tower? - Bassett pondered, remembering
his Browning and gazing at his skeleton-like and fever-wasted hands.&nbsp;
And the fancy made him smile - of Childe Roland bearing a slug-horn
to his lips with an arm as feeble as his was.&nbsp; Was it months, or
years, he asked himself, since he first heard that mysterious call on
the beach at Ringmanu?&nbsp; To save himself he could not tell.&nbsp;
The long sickness had been most long.&nbsp; In conscious count of time
he knew of months, many of them; but he had no way of estimating the
long intervals of delirium and stupor.&nbsp; And how fared Captain Bateman
of the blackbirder <i>Nari</i>? he wondered; and had Captain Bateman&rsquo;s
drunken mate died of delirium tremens yet?</p>
<p>From which vain speculations, Bassett turned idly to review all that
had occurred since that day on the beach of Ringmanu when he first heard
the sound and plunged into the jungle after it.&nbsp; Sagawa had protested.&nbsp;
He could see him yet, his queer little monkeyish face eloquent with
fear, his back burdened with specimen cases, in his hands Bassett&rsquo;s
butterfly net and naturalist&rsquo;s shot-gun, as he quavered, in B&ecirc;che-de-mer
English: &ldquo;Me fella too much fright along bush.&nbsp; Bad fella
boy, too much stop&rsquo;m along bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassett smiled sadly at the recollection.&nbsp; The little New Hanover
boy had been frightened, but had proved faithful, following him without
hesitancy into the bush in the quest after the source of the wonderful
sound.&nbsp; No fire-hollowed tree-trunk, that, throbbing war through
the jungle depths, had been Bassett&rsquo;s conclusion.&nbsp; Erroneous
had been his next conclusion, namely, that the source or cause could
not be more distant than an hour&rsquo;s walk, and that he would easily
be back by mid-afternoon to be picked up by the <i>Nari&rsquo;s</i>
whale-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That big fella noise no good, all the same devil-devil,&rdquo;
Sagawa had adjudged.&nbsp; And Sagawa had been right.&nbsp; Had he not
had his head hacked off within the day?&nbsp; Bassett shuddered.&nbsp;
Without doubt Sagawa had been eaten as well by the &ldquo;bad fella
boys too much&rdquo; that stopped along the bush.&nbsp; He could see
him, as he had last seen him, stripped of the shot-gun and all the naturalist&rsquo;s
gear of his master, lying on the narrow trail where he had been decapitated
barely the moment before.&nbsp; Yes, within a minute the thing had happened.&nbsp;
Within a minute, looking back, Bassett had seen him trudging patiently
along under his burdens.&nbsp; Then Bassett&rsquo;s own trouble had
come upon him.&nbsp; He looked at the cruelly healed stumps of the first
and second fingers of his left hand, then rubbed them softly into the
indentation in the back of his skull.&nbsp; Quick as had been the flash
of the long handled tomahawk, he had been quick enough to duck away
his head and partially to deflect the stroke with his up-flung hand.&nbsp;
Two fingers and a hasty scalp-wound had been the price he paid for his
life.&nbsp; With one barrel of his ten-gauge shot-gun he had blown the
life out of the bushman who had so nearly got him; with the other barrel
he had peppered the bushmen bending over Sagawa, and had the pleasure
of knowing that the major portion of the charge had gone into the one
who leaped away with Sagawa&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Everything had occurred
in a flash.&nbsp; Only himself, the slain bushman, and what remained
of Sagawa, were in the narrow, wild-pig run of a path.&nbsp; From the
dark jungle on either side came no rustle of movement or sound of life.&nbsp;
And he had suffered distinct and dreadful shock.&nbsp; For the first
time in his life he had killed a human being, and he knew nausea as
he contemplated the mess of his handiwork.</p>
<p>Then had begun the chase.&nbsp; He retreated up the pig-run before
his hunters, who were between him and the beach.&nbsp; How many there
were, he could not guess.&nbsp; There might have been one, or a hundred,
for aught he saw of them.&nbsp; That some of them took to the trees
and travelled along through the jungle roof he was certain; but at the
most he never glimpsed more than an occasional flitting of shadows.&nbsp;
 No bow-strings twanged that he could hear; but every little while,
whence discharged he knew not, tiny arrows whispered past him or struck
tree-boles and fluttered to the ground beside him.&nbsp; They were bone-tipped
and feather shafted, and the feathers, torn from the breasts of humming-birds,
iridesced like jewels.</p>
<p>Once - and now, after the long lapse of time, he chuckled gleefully
at the recollection - he had detected a shadow above him that came to
instant rest as he turned his gaze upward.&nbsp; He could make out nothing,
but, deciding to chance it, had fired at it a heavy charge of number
five shot.&nbsp; Squalling like an infuriated cat, the shadow crashed
down through tree-ferns and orchids and thudded upon the earth at his
feet, and, still squalling its rage and pain, had sunk its human teeth
into the ankle of his stout tramping boot.&nbsp; He, on the other hand,
was not idle, and with his free foot had done what reduced the squalling
to silence.&nbsp; So inured to savagery has Bassett since become, that
he chuckled again with the glee of the recollection.</p>
<p>What a night had followed!&nbsp; Small wonder that he had accumulated
such a virulence and variety of fevers, he thought, as he recalled that
sleepless night of torment, when the throb of his wounds was as nothing
compared with the myriad stings of the mosquitoes.&nbsp; There had been
no escaping them, and he had not dared to light a fire.&nbsp; They had
literally pumped his body full of poison, so that, with the coming of
day, eyes swollen almost shut, he had stumbled blindly on, not caring
much when his head should be hacked off and his carcass started on the
way of Sagawa&rsquo;s to the cooking fire.&nbsp; Twenty-four hours had
made a wreck of him - of mind as well as body.&nbsp; He had scarcely
retained his wits at all, so maddened was he by the tremendous inoculation
of poison he had received.&nbsp; Several times he fired his shot-gun
with effect into the shadows that dogged him.&nbsp; Stinging day insects
and gnats added to his torment, while his bloody wounds attracted hosts
of loathsome flies that clung sluggishly to his flesh and had to be
brushed off and crushed off.</p>
<p>Once, in that day, he heard again the wonderful sound, seemingly
more distant, but rising imperiously above the nearer war-drums in the
bush.&nbsp; Right there was where he had made his mistake.&nbsp; Thinking
that he had passed beyond it and that, therefore, it was between him
and the beach of Ringmanu, he had worked back toward it when in reality
he was penetrating deeper and deeper into the mysterious heart of the
unexplored island.&nbsp; That night, crawling in among the twisted roots
of a banyan tree, he had slept from exhaustion while the mosquitoes
had had their will of him.</p>
<p>Followed days and nights that were vague as nightmares in his memory.&nbsp;
One clear vision he remembered was of suddenly finding himself in the
midst of a bush village and watching the old men and children fleeing
into the jungle.&nbsp; All had fled but one.&nbsp; From close at hand
and above him, a whimpering as of some animal in pain and terror had
startled him.&nbsp; And looking up he had seen her - a girl, or young
woman rather, suspended by one arm in the cooking sun.&nbsp; Perhaps
for days she had so hung.&nbsp; Her swollen, protruding tongue spoke
as much.&nbsp; Still alive, she gazed at him with eyes of terror.&nbsp;
Past help, he decided, as he noted the swellings of her legs which advertised
that the joints had been crushed and the great bones broken.&nbsp; He
resolved to shoot her, and there the vision terminated.&nbsp; He could
not remember whether he had or not, any more than could he remember
how he chanced to be in that village, or how he succeeded in getting
away from it.</p>
<p>Many pictures, unrelated, came and went in Bassett&rsquo;s mind as
he reviewed that period of his terrible wanderings.&nbsp; He remembered
invading another village of a dozen houses and driving all before him
with his shot-gun save, for one old man, too feeble to flee, who spat
at him and whined and snarled as he dug open a ground-oven and from
amid the hot stones dragged forth a roasted pig that steamed its essence
deliciously through its green-leaf wrappings.&nbsp; It was at this place
that a wantonness of savagery had seized upon him.&nbsp; Having feasted,
ready to depart with a hind-quarter of the pig in his hand, he deliberately
fired the grass thatch of a house with his burning glass.</p>
<p>But seared deepest of all in Bassett&rsquo;s brain, was the dank
and noisome jungle.&nbsp; It actually stank with evil, and it was always
twilight.&nbsp; Rarely did a shaft of sunlight penetrate its matted
roof a hundred feet overhead.&nbsp; And beneath that roof was an aerial
ooze of vegetation, a monstrous, parasitic dripping of decadent life-forms
that rooted in death and lived on death.&nbsp; And through all this
he drifted, ever pursued by the flitting shadows of the anthropophagi,
themselves ghosts of evil that dared not face him in battle but that
knew that, soon or late, they would feed on him.&nbsp; Bassett remembered
that at the time, in lucid moments, he had likened himself to a wounded
bull pursued by plains&rsquo; coyotes too cowardly to battle with him
for the meat of him, yet certain of the inevitable end of him when they
would be full gorged.&nbsp; As the bull&rsquo;s horns and stamping hoofs
kept off the coyotes, so his shot-gun kept off these Solomon Islanders,
these twilight shades of bushmen of the island of Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>Came the day of the grass lands.&nbsp; Abruptly, as if cloven by
the sword of God in the hand of God, the jungle terminated.&nbsp; The
edge of it, perpendicular and as black as the infamy of it, was a hundred
feet up and down.&nbsp; And, beginning at the edge of it, grew the grass
- sweet, soft, tender, pasture grass that would have delighted the eyes
and beasts of any husbandman and that extended, on and on, for leagues
and leagues of velvet verdure, to the backbone of the great island,
the towering mountain range flung up by some ancient earth-cataclysm,
serrated and gullied but not yet erased by the erosive tropic rains.&nbsp;
But the grass!&nbsp; He had crawled into it a dozen yards, buried his
face in it, smelled it, and broken down in a fit of involuntary weeping.</p>
<p>And, while he wept, the wonderful sound had pealed forth - if by
<i>peal</i>, he had often thought since, an adequate description could
be given of the enunciation of so vast a sound melting sweet.&nbsp;
Sweet it was, as no sound ever heard.&nbsp; Vast it was, of so mighty
a resonance that it might have proceeded from some brazen-throated monster.&nbsp;
And yet it called to him across that leagues-wide savannah, and was
like a benediction to his long-suffering, pain racked spirit.</p>
<p>He remembered how he lay there in the grass, wet-cheeked but no longer
sobbing, listening to the sound and wondering that he had been able
to hear it on the beach of Ringmanu.&nbsp; Some freak of air pressures
and air currents, he reflected, had made it possible for the sound to
carry so far.&nbsp; Such conditions might not happen again in a thousand
days or ten thousand days, but the one day it had happened had been
the day he landed from the <i>Nari</i> for several hours&rsquo; collecting.&nbsp;
Especially had he been in quest of the famed jungle butterfly, a foot
across from wing-tip to wing-tip, as velvet-dusky of lack of colour
as was the gloom of the roof, of such lofty arboreal habits that it
resorted only to the jungle roof and could be brought down only by a
dose of shot.&nbsp; It was for this purpose that Sagawa had carried
the ten-gauge shot-gun.</p>
<p>Two days and nights he had spent crawling across that belt of grass
land.&nbsp; He had suffered much, but pursuit had ceased at the jungle-edge.&nbsp;
And he would have died of thirst had not a heavy thunderstorm revived
him on the second day.</p>
<p>And then had come Balatta.&nbsp; In the first shade, where the savannah
yielded to the dense mountain jungle, he had collapsed to die.&nbsp;
At first she had squealed with delight at sight of his helplessness,
and was for beating his brain out with a stout forest branch.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was his very utter helplessness that had appealed to her,
and perhaps it was her human curiosity that made her refrain.&nbsp;
At any rate, she had refrained, for he opened his eyes again under the
impending blow, and saw her studying him intently.&nbsp; What especially
struck her about him were his blue eyes and white skin.&nbsp; Coolly
she had squatted on her hams, spat on his arm, and with her finger-tips
scrubbed away the dirt of days and nights of muck and jungle that sullied
the pristine whiteness of his skin.</p>
<p>And everything about her had struck him especially, although there
was nothing conventional about her at all.&nbsp; He laughed weakly at
the recollection, for she had been as innocent of garb as Eve before
the fig-leaf adventure.&nbsp; Squat and lean at the same time, asymmetrically
limbed, string-muscled as if with lengths of cordage, dirt-caked from
infancy save for casual showers, she was as unbeautiful a prototype
of woman as he, with a scientist&rsquo;s eye, had ever gazed upon.&nbsp;
Her breasts advertised at the one time her maturity and youth; and,
if by nothing else, her sex was advertised by the one article of finery
with which she was adorned, namely a pig&rsquo;s tail, thrust though
a hole in her left ear-lobe.&nbsp; So lately had the tail been severed,
that its raw end still oozed blood that dried upon her shoulder like
so much candle-droppings.&nbsp; And her face!&nbsp; A twisted and wizened
complex of apish features, perforated by upturned, sky-open, Mongolian
nostrils, by a mouth that sagged from a huge upper-lip and faded precipitately
into a retreating chin, by peering querulous eyes that blinked as blink
the eyes of denizens of monkey-cages.</p>
<p>Not even the water she brought him in a forest-leaf, and the ancient
and half-putrid chunk of roast pig, could redeem in the slightest the
grotesque hideousness of her.&nbsp; When he had eaten weakly for a space,
he closed his eyes in order not to see her, although again and again
she poked them open to peer at the blue of them.&nbsp; Then had come
the sound.&nbsp; Nearer, much nearer, he knew it to be; and he knew
equally well, despite the weary way he had come, that it was still many
hours distant.&nbsp; The effect of it on her had been startling.&nbsp;
She cringed under it, with averted face, moaning and chattering with
fear.&nbsp; But after it had lived its full life of an hour, he closed
his eyes and fell asleep with Balatta brushing the flies from him.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was night, and she was gone.&nbsp; But he was aware
of renewed strength, and, by then too thoroughly inoculated by the mosquito
poison to suffer further inflammation, he closed his eyes and slept
an unbroken stretch till sun-up.&nbsp; A little later Balatta had returned,
bringing with her a half-dozen women who, unbeautiful as they were,
were patently not so unbeautiful as she.&nbsp; She evidenced by her
conduct that she considered him her find, her property, and the pride
she took in showing him off would have been ludicrous had his situation
not been so desperate.</p>
<p>Later, after what had been to him a terrible journey of miles, when
he collapsed in front of the devil-devil house in the shadow of the
breadfruit tree, she had shown very lively ideas on the matter of retaining
possession of him.&nbsp; Ngurn, whom Bassett was to know afterward as
the devil-devil doctor, priest, or medicine man of the village, had
wanted his head.&nbsp; Others of the grinning and chattering monkey-men,
all as stark of clothes and bestial of appearance as Balatta, had wanted
his body for the roasting oven.&nbsp; At that time he had not understood
their language, if by <i>language</i> might be dignified the uncouth
sounds they made to represent ideas.&nbsp; But Bassett had thoroughly
understood the matter of debate, especially when the men pressed and
prodded and felt of the flesh of him as if he were so much commodity
in a butcher&rsquo;s stall.</p>
<p>Balatta had been losing the debate rapidly, when the accident happened.&nbsp;
One of the men, curiously examining Bassett&rsquo;s shot-gun, managed
to cock and pull a trigger.&nbsp; The recoil of the butt into the pit
of the man&rsquo;s stomach had not been the most sanguinary result,
for the charge of shot, at a distance of a yard, had blown the head
of one of the debaters into nothingness.</p>
<p>Even Balatta joined the others in flight, and, ere they returned,
his senses already reeling from the oncoming fever-attack, Bassett had
regained possession of the gun.&nbsp; Whereupon, although his teeth
chattered with the ague and his swimming eyes could scarcely see, he
held on to his fading consciousness until he could intimidate the bushmen
with the simple magics of compass, watch, burning glass, and matches.&nbsp;
At the last, with due emphasis, of solemnity and awfulness, he had killed
a young pig with his shot-gun and promptly fainted.</p>
<p>Bassett flexed his arm-muscles in quest of what possible strength
might reside in such weakness, and dragged himself slowly and totteringly
to his feet.&nbsp; He was shockingly emaciated; yet, during the various
convalescences of the many months of his long sickness, he had never
regained quite the same degree of strength as this time.&nbsp; What
he feared was another relapse such as he had already frequently experienced.&nbsp;
Without drugs, without even quinine, he had managed so far to live through
a combination of the most pernicious and most malignant of malarial
and black-water fevers.&nbsp; But could he continue to endure?&nbsp;
Such was his everlasting query.&nbsp; For, like the genuine scientist
he was, he would not be content to die until he had solved the secret
of the sound.</p>
<p>Supported by a staff, he staggered the few steps to the devil-devil
house where death and Ngurn reigned in gloom.&nbsp; Almost as infamously
dark and evil-stinking as the jungle was the devil-devil house - in
Bassett&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; Yet therein was usually to be found his
favourite crony and gossip, Ngurn, always willing for a yarn or a discussion,
the while he sat in the ashes of death and in a slow smoke shrewdly
revolved curing human heads suspended from the rafters.&nbsp; For, through
the months&rsquo; interval of consciousness of his long sickness, Bassett
had mastered the psychological simplicities and lingual difficulties
of the language of the tribe of Ngurn and Balatta and Vngngn - the latter
the addle-headed young chief who was ruled by Ngurn, and who, whispered
intrigue had it, was the son of Ngurn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the Red One speak to-day?&rdquo; Bassett asked, by this
time so accustomed to the old man&rsquo;s gruesome occupation as to
take even an interest in the progress of the smoke-curing.</p>
<p>With the eye of an expert Ngurn examined the particular head he was
at work upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be ten days before I can say &lsquo;finish,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never has any man fixed heads like these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassett smiled inwardly at the old fellow&rsquo;s reluctance to talk
with him of the Red One.&nbsp; It had always been so.&nbsp; Never, by
any chance, had Ngurn or any other member of the weird tribe divulged
the slightest hint of any physical characteristic of the Red One.&nbsp;
Physical the Red One must be, to emit the wonderful sound, and though
it was called the Red One, Bassett could not be sure that red represented
the colour of it.&nbsp; Red enough were the deeds and powers of it,
from what abstract clues he had gleaned.&nbsp; Not alone, had Ngurn
informed him, was the Red One more bestial powerful than the neighbour
tribal gods, ever athirst for the red blood of living human sacrifices,
but the neighbour gods themselves were sacrificed and tormented before
him.&nbsp; He was the god of a dozen allied villages similar to this
one, which was the central and commanding village of the federation.&nbsp;
By virtue of the Red One many alien villages had been devastated and
even wiped out, the prisoners sacrificed to the Red One.&nbsp; This
was true to-day, and it extended back into old history carried down
by word of mouth through the generations.&nbsp; When he, Ngurn, had
been a young man, the tribes beyond the grass lands had made a war raid.&nbsp;
In the counter raid, Ngurn and his fighting folk had made many prisoners.&nbsp;
Of children alone over five score living had been bled white before
the Red One, and many, many more men and women.</p>
<p>The Thunderer was another of Ngurn&rsquo;s names for the mysterious
deity.&nbsp; Also at times was he called The Loud Shouter, The God-Voiced,
The Bird-Throated, The One with the Throat Sweet as the Throat of the
Honey-Bird, The Sun Singer, and The Star-Born.</p>
<p>Why The Star-Born?&nbsp; In vain Bassett interrogated Ngurn.&nbsp;
According to that old devil-devil doctor, the Red One had always been,
just where he was at present, for ever singing and thundering his will
over men.&nbsp; But Ngurn&rsquo;s father, wrapped in decaying grass-matting
and hanging even then over their heads among the smoky rafters of the
devil-devil house, had held otherwise.&nbsp; That departed wise one
had believed that the Red One came from out of the starry night, else
why - so his argument had run - had the old and forgotten ones passed
his name down as the Star-Born?&nbsp; Bassett could not but recognize
something cogent in such argument.&nbsp; But Ngurn affirmed the long
years of his long life, wherein he had gazed upon many starry nights,
yet never had he found a star on grass land or in jungle depth - and
he had looked for them.&nbsp; True, he had beheld shooting stars (this
in reply to Bassett&rsquo;s contention); but likewise had he beheld
the phosphorescence of fungoid growths and rotten meat and fireflies
on dark nights, and the flames of wood-fires and of blazing candle-nuts;
yet what were flame and blaze and glow when they had flamed and blazed
and glowed?&nbsp; Answer: memories, memories only, of things which had
ceased to be, like memories of matings accomplished, of feasts forgotten,
of desires that were the ghosts of desires, flaring, flaming, burning,
yet unrealized in achievement of easement and satisfaction.&nbsp; Where
was the appetite of yesterday? the roasted flesh of the wild pig the
hunter&rsquo;s arrow failed to slay? the maid, unwed and dead ere the
young man knew her?</p>
<p>A memory was not a star, was Ngurn&rsquo;s contention.&nbsp; How
could a memory be a star?&nbsp; Further, after all his long life he
still observed the starry night-sky unaltered.&nbsp; Never had he noted
the absence of a single star from its accustomed place.&nbsp; Besides,
stars were fire, and the Red One was not fire - which last involuntary
betrayal told Bassett nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the Red One speak to-morrow?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>Ngurn shrugged his shoulders as who should say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the day after? - and the day after that?&rdquo; Bassett
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to have the curing of your head,&rdquo; Ngurn
changed the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is different from any other head.&nbsp;
No devil-devil has a head like it.&nbsp; Besides, I would cure it well.&nbsp;
I would take months and months.&nbsp; The moons would come and the moons
would go, and the smoke would be very slow, and I should myself gather
the materials for the curing smoke.&nbsp; The skin would not wrinkle.&nbsp;
It would be as smooth as your skin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up, and from the dim rafters, grimed with the smoking of
countless heads, where day was no more than a gloom, took down a matting-wrapped
parcel and began to open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a head like yours,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is
poorly cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassett had pricked up his ears at the suggestion that it was a white
man&rsquo;s head; for he had long since come to accept that these jungle-dwellers,
in the midmost centre of the great island, had never had intercourse
with white men.&nbsp; Certainly he had found them without the almost
universal b&ecirc;che-de-mer English of the west South Pacific.&nbsp;
Nor had they knowledge of tobacco, nor of gunpowder.&nbsp; Their few
precious knives, made from lengths of hoop-iron, and their few and more
precious tomahawks from cheap trade hatchets, he had surmised they had
captured in war from the bushmen of the jungle beyond the grass lands,
and that they, in turn, had similarly gained them from the salt-water
men who fringed the coral beaches of the shore and had contact with
the occasional white men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folk in the out beyond do not know how to cure heads,&rdquo;
old Ngurn explained, as he drew forth from the filthy matting and placed
in Bassett&rsquo;s hands an indubitable white man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Ancient it was beyond question; white it was as the blond hair attested.&nbsp;
He could have sworn it once belonged to an Englishman, and to an Englishman
of long before by token of the heavy gold circlets still threaded in
the withered ear-lobes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now your head . . . &rdquo; the devil-devil doctor began on
his favourite topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; Bassett interrupted, struck
by a new idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I die I&rsquo;ll let you have my head
to cure, if, first, you take me to look upon the Red One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have your head anyway when you are dead,&rdquo; Ngurn
rejected the proposition.&nbsp; He added, with the brutal frankness
of the savage: &ldquo;Besides, you have not long to live.&nbsp; You
are almost a dead man now.&nbsp; You will grow less strong.&nbsp; In
not many months I shall have you here turning and turning in the smoke.&nbsp;
It is pleasant, through the long afternoons, to turn the head of one
you have known as well as I know you.&nbsp; And I shall talk to you
and tell you the many secrets you want to know.&nbsp; Which will not
matter, for you will be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ngurn,&rdquo; Bassett threatened in sudden anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know the Baby Thunder in the Iron that is mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This was
in reference to his all-potent and all-awful shotgun.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can kill you any time, and then you will not get my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, will Vngngn, or some one else of my folk get
it,&rdquo; Ngurn complacently assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And just the
same will it turn here in the and turn devil-devil house in the smoke.&nbsp;
The quicker you slay me with your Baby Thunder, the quicker will your
head turn in the smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bassett knew he was beaten in the discussion.</p>
<p>What was the Red One? - Bassett asked himself a thousand times in
the succeeding week, while he seemed to grow stronger.&nbsp; What was
the source of the wonderful sound?&nbsp; What was this Sun Singer, this
Star-Born One, this mysterious deity, as bestial-conducted as the black
and kinky-headed and monkey-like human beasts who worshipped it, and
whose silver-sweet, bull-mouthed singing and commanding he had heard
at the taboo distance for so long?</p>
<p>Ngurn had he failed to bribe with the inevitable curing of his head
when he was dead.&nbsp; Vngngn, imbecile and chief that he was, was
too imbecilic, too much under the sway of Ngurn, to be considered.&nbsp;
Remained Balatta, who, from the time she found him and poked his blue
eyes open to recrudescence of her grotesque female hideousness, had
continued his adorer.&nbsp; Woman she was, and he had long known that
the only way to win from her treason of her tribe was through the woman&rsquo;s
heart of her.</p>
<p>Bassett was a fastidious man.&nbsp; He had never recovered from the
initial horror caused by Balatta&rsquo;s female awfulness.&nbsp; Back
in England, even at best the charm of woman, to him, had never been
robust.&nbsp; Yet now, resolutely, as only a man can do who is capable
of martyring himself for the cause of science, he proceeded to violate
all the fineness and delicacy of his nature by making love to the unthinkably
disgusting bushwoman.</p>
<p>He shuddered, but with averted face hid his grimaces and swallowed
his gorge as he put his arm around her dirt-crusted shoulders and felt
the contact of her rancidoily and kinky hair with his neck and chin.&nbsp;
But he nearly screamed when she succumbed to that caress so at the very
first of the courtship and mowed and gibbered and squealed little, queer,
pig-like gurgly noises of delight.&nbsp; It was too much.&nbsp; And
the next he did in the singular courtship was to take her down to the
stream and give her a vigorous scrubbing.</p>
<p>From then on he devoted himself to her like a true swain as frequently
and for as long at a time as his will could override his repugnance.&nbsp;
But marriage, which she ardently suggested, with due observance of tribal
custom, he balked at.&nbsp; Fortunately, taboo rule was strong in the
tribe.&nbsp; Thus, Ngurn could never touch bone, or flesh, or hide of
crocodile.&nbsp; This had been ordained at his birth.&nbsp; Vngngn was
denied ever the touch of woman.&nbsp; Such pollution, did it chance
to occur, could be purged only by the death of the offending female.&nbsp;
It had happened once, since Bassett&rsquo;s arrival, when a girl of
nine, running in play, stumbled and fell against the sacred chief.&nbsp;
And the girl-child was seen no more.&nbsp; In whispers, Balatta told
Bassett that she had been three days and nights in dying before the
Red One.&nbsp; As for Balatta, the breadfruit was taboo to her.&nbsp;
For which Bassett was thankful.&nbsp; The taboo might have been water.</p>
<p>For himself, he fabricated a special taboo.&nbsp; Only could he marry,
he explained, when the Southern Cross rode highest in the sky.&nbsp;
Knowing his astronomy, he thus gained a reprieve of nearly nine months;
and he was confident that within that time he would either be dead or
escaped to the coast with full knowledge of the Red One and of the source
of the Red One&rsquo;s wonderful voice.&nbsp; At first he had fancied
the Red One to be some colossal statue, like Memnon, rendered vocal
under certain temperature conditions of sunlight.&nbsp; But when, after
a war raid, a batch of prisoners was brought in and the sacrifice made
at night, in the midst of rain, when the sun could play no part, the
Red One had been more vocal than usual, Bassett discarded that hypothesis.</p>
<p>In company with Balatta, sometimes with men and parties of women,
the freedom of the jungle was his for three quadrants of the compass.&nbsp;
But the fourth quadrant, which contained the Red One&rsquo;s abiding
place, was taboo.&nbsp; He made more thorough love to Balatta - also
saw to it that she scrubbed herself more frequently.&nbsp; Eternal female
she was, capable of any treason for the sake of love.&nbsp; And, though
the sight of her was provocative of nausea and the contact of her provocative
of despair, although he could not escape her awfulness in his dream-haunted
nightmares of her, he nevertheless was aware of the cosmic verity of
sex that animated her and that made her own life of less value than
the happiness of her lover with whom she hoped to mate.&nbsp; Juliet
or Balatta?&nbsp; Where was the intrinsic difference?&nbsp; The soft
and tender product of ultra-civilization, or her bestial prototype of
a hundred thousand years before her? - there was no difference.</p>
<p>Bassett was a scientist first, a humanist afterward.&nbsp; In the
jungle-heart of Guadalcanal he put the affair to the test, as in the
laboratory he would have put to the test any chemical reaction.&nbsp;
He increased his feigned ardour for the bushwoman, at the same time
increasing the imperiousness of his will of desire over her to be led
to look upon the Red One face to face.&nbsp; It was the old story, he
recognized, that the woman must pay, and it occurred when the two of
them, one day, were catching the unclassified and unnamed little black
fish, an inch long, half-eel and half-scaled, rotund with salmon-golden
roe, that frequented the fresh water, and that were esteemed, raw and
whole, fresh or putrid, a perfect delicacy.&nbsp; Prone in the muck
of the decaying jungle-floor, Balatta threw herself, clutching his ankles
with her hands kissing his feet and making slubbery noises that chilled
his backbone up and down again.&nbsp; She begged him to kill her rather
than exact this ultimate love-payment.&nbsp; She told him of the penalty
of breaking the taboo of the Red One - a week of torture, living, the
details of which she yammered out from her face in the mire until he
realized that he was yet a tyro in knowledge of the frightfulness the
human was capable of wreaking on the human.</p>
<p>Yet did Bassett insist on having his man&rsquo;s will satisfied,
at the woman&rsquo;s risk, that he might solve the mystery of the Red
One&rsquo;s singing, though she should die long and horribly and screaming.&nbsp;
And Balatta, being mere woman, yielded.&nbsp; She led him into the forbidden
quadrant.&nbsp; An abrupt mountain, shouldering in from the north to
meet a similar intrusion from the south, tormented the stream in which
they had fished into a deep and gloomy gorge.&nbsp; After a mile along
the gorge, the way plunged sharply upward until they crossed a saddle
of raw limestone which attracted his geologist&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Still
climbing, although he paused often from sheer physical weakness, they
scaled forest-clad heights until they emerged on a naked mesa or tableland.&nbsp;
Bassett recognized the stuff of its composition as black volcanic sand,
and knew that a pocket magnet could have captured a full load of the
sharply angular grains he trod upon.</p>
<p>And then holding Balatta by the hand and leading her onward, he came
to it - a tremendous pit, obviously artificial, in the heart of the
plateau.&nbsp; Old history, the South Seas Sailing Directions, scores
of remembered data and connotations swift and furious, surged through
his brain.&nbsp; It was Mendana who had discovered the islands and named
them Solomon&rsquo;s, believing that he had found that monarch&rsquo;s
fabled mines.&nbsp; They had laughed at the old navigator&rsquo;s child-like
credulity; and yet here stood himself, Bassett, on the rim of an excavation
for all the world like the diamond pits of South Africa.</p>
<p>But no diamond this that he gazed down upon.&nbsp; Rather was it
a pearl, with the depth of iridescence of a pearl; but of a size all
pearls of earth and time, welded into one, could not have totalled;
and of a colour undreamed of in any pearl, or of anything else, for
that matter, for it was the colour of the Red One.&nbsp; And the Red
One himself Bassett knew it to be on the instant.&nbsp; A perfect sphere,
full two hundred feet in diameter, the top of it was a hundred feet
below the level of the rim.&nbsp; He likened the colour quality of it
to lacquer.&nbsp; Indeed, he took it to be some sort of lacquer, applied
by man, but a lacquer too marvellously clever to have been manufactured
by the bush-folk.&nbsp; Brighter than bright cherry-red, its richness
of colour was as if it were red builded upon red.&nbsp; It glowed and
iridesced in the sunlight as if gleaming up from underlay under underlay
of red.</p>
<p>In vain Balatta strove to dissuade him from descending.&nbsp; She
threw herself in the dirt; but, when he continued down the trail that
spiralled the pit-wall, she followed, cringing and whimpering her terror.&nbsp;
That the red sphere had been dug out as a precious thing, was patent.&nbsp;
Considering the paucity of members of the federated twelve villages
and their primitive tools and methods, Bassett knew that the toil of
a myriad generations could scarcely have made that enormous excavation.</p>
<p>He found the pit bottom carpeted with human bones, among which, battered
and defaced, lay village gods of wood and stone.&nbsp; Some, covered
with obscene totemic figures and designs, were carved from solid tree
trunks forty or fifty feet in length.&nbsp; He noted the absence of
the shark and turtle gods, so common among the shore villages, and was
amazed at the constant recurrence of the helmet motive.&nbsp; What did
these jungle savages of the dark heart of Guadalcanal know of helmets?&nbsp;
Had Mendana&rsquo;s men-at-arms worn helmets and penetrated here centuries
before?&nbsp; And if not, then whence had the bush-folk caught the motive?</p>
<p>Advancing over the litter of gods and bones, Balatta whimpering at
his heels, Bassett entered the shadow of the Red One and passed on under
its gigantic overhang until he touched it with his finger-tips.&nbsp;
No lacquer that.&nbsp; Nor was the surface smooth as it should have
been in the case of lacquer.&nbsp; On the contrary, it was corrugated
and pitted, with here and there patches that showed signs of heat and
fusing.&nbsp; Also, the substance of it was metal, though unlike any
metal, or combination of metals, he had ever known.&nbsp; As for the
colour itself, he decided it to be no application.&nbsp; It was the
intrinsic colour of the metal itself.</p>
<p>He moved his finger-tips, which up to that had merely rested, along
the surface, and felt the whole gigantic sphere quicken and live and
respond.&nbsp; It was incredible!&nbsp; So light a touch on so vast
a mass!&nbsp; Yet did it quiver under the finger-tip caress in rhythmic
vibrations that became whisperings and rustlings and mutterings of sound
- but of sound so different; so elusively thin that it was shimmeringly
sibilant; so mellow that it was maddening sweet, piping like an elfin
horn, which last was just what Bassett decided would be like a peal
from some bell of the gods reaching earthward from across space.</p>
<p>He looked at Balatta with swift questioning; but the voice of the
Red One he had evoked had flung her face downward and moaning among
the bones.&nbsp; He returned to contemplation of the prodigy.&nbsp;
Hollow it was, and of no metal known on earth, was his conclusion.&nbsp;
It was right-named by the ones of old-time as the Star-Born.&nbsp; Only
from the stars could it have come, and no thing of chance was it.&nbsp;
It was a creation of artifice and mind.&nbsp; Such perfection of form,
such hollowness that it certainly possessed, could not be the result
of mere fortuitousness.&nbsp; A child of intelligences, remote and unguessable,
working corporally in metals, it indubitably was.&nbsp; He stared at
it in amaze, his brain a racing wild-fire of hypotheses to account for
this far-journeyer who had adventured the night of space, threaded the
stars, and now rose before him and above him, exhumed by patient anthropophagi,
pitted and lacquered by its fiery bath in two atmospheres.</p>
<p>But was the colour a lacquer of heat upon some familiar metal?&nbsp;
Or was it an intrinsic quality of the metal itself?&nbsp; He thrust
in the blue-point of his pocket-knife to test the constitution of the
stuff.&nbsp; Instantly the entire sphere burst into a mighty whispering,
sharp with protest, almost twanging goldenly, if a whisper could possibly
be considered to twang, rising higher, sinking deeper, the two extremes
of the registry of sound threatening to complete the circle and coalesce
into the bull-mouthed thundering he had so often heard beyond the taboo
distance.</p>
<p>Forgetful of safety, of his own life itself, entranced by the wonder
of the unthinkable and unguessable thing, he raised his knife to strike
heavily from a long stroke, but was prevented by Balatta.&nbsp; She
upreared on her own knees in an agony of terror, clasping his knees
and supplicating him to desist.&nbsp; In the intensity of her desire
to impress him, she put her forearm between her teeth and sank them
to the bone.</p>
<p>He scarcely observed her act, although he yielded automatically to
his gentler instincts and withheld the knife-hack.&nbsp; To him, human
life had dwarfed to microscopic proportions before this colossal portent
of higher life from within the distances of the sidereal universe.&nbsp;
As had she been a dog, he kicked the ugly little bushwoman to her feet
and compelled her to start with him on an encirclement of the base.&nbsp;
Part way around, he encountered horrors.&nbsp; Even, among the others,
did he recognize the sun-shrivelled remnant of the nine-years girl who
had accidentally broken Chief Vngngn&rsquo;s personality taboo.&nbsp;
And, among what was left of these that had passed, he encountered what
was left of one who had not yet passed.&nbsp; Truly had the bush-folk
named themselves into the name of the Red One, seeing in him their own
image which they strove to placate and please with such red offerings.</p>
<p>Farther around, always treading the bones and images of humans and
gods that constituted the floor of this ancient charnel-house of sacrifice,
he came upon the device by which the Red One was made to send his call
singing thunderingly across the jungle-belts and grass-lands to the
far beach of Ringmanu.&nbsp; Simple and primitive was it as was the
Red One&rsquo;s consummate artifice.&nbsp; A great king-post, half a
hundred feet in length, seasoned by centuries of superstitious care,
carven into dynasties of gods, each superimposed, each helmeted, each
seated in the open mouth of a crocodile, was slung by ropes, twisted
of climbing vegetable parasites, from the apex of a tripod of three
great forest trunks, themselves carved into grinning and grotesque adumbrations
of man&rsquo;s modern concepts of art and god.&nbsp; From the striker
king-post, were suspended ropes of climbers to which men could apply
their strength and direction.&nbsp; Like a battering ram, this king-post
could be driven end-onward against the mighty red-iridescent sphere.</p>
<p>Here was where Ngurn officiated and functioned religiously for himself
and the twelve tribes under him.&nbsp; Bassett laughed aloud, almost
with madness, at the thought of this wonderful messenger, winged with
intelligence across space, to fall into a bushman stronghold and be
worshipped by ape-like, man-eating and head-hunting savages.&nbsp; It
was as if God&rsquo;s World had fallen into the muck mire of the abyss
underlying the bottom of hell; as if Jehovah&rsquo;s Commandments had
been presented on carved stone to the monkeys of the monkey cage at
the Zoo; as if the Sermon on the Mount had been preached in a roaring
bedlam of lunatics.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>The slow weeks passed.&nbsp; The nights, by election, Bassett spent
on the ashen floor of the devil-devil house, beneath the ever-swinging,
slow-curing heads.&nbsp; His reason for this was that it was taboo to
the lesser sex of woman, and therefore, a refuge for him from Balatta,
who grew more persecutingly and perilously loverly as the Southern Cross
rode higher in the sky and marked the imminence of her nuptials.&nbsp;
His days Bassett spent in a hammock swung under the shade of the great
breadfruit tree before the devil-devil house.&nbsp; There were breaks
in this programme, when, in the comas of his devastating fever-attacks,
he lay for days and nights in the house of heads.&nbsp; Ever he struggled
to combat the fever, to live, to continue to live, to grow strong and
stronger against the day when he would be strong enough to dare the
grass-lands and the belted jungle beyond, and win to the beach, and
to some labour-recruiting, black-birding ketch or schooner, and on to
civilization and the men of civilization, to whom he could give news
of the message from other worlds that lay, darkly worshipped by beastmen,
in the black heart of Guadalcanal&rsquo;s midmost centre.</p>
<p>On the other nights, lying late under the breadfruit tree, Bassett
spent long hours watching the slow setting of the western stars beyond
the black wall of jungle where it had been thrust back by the clearing
for the village.&nbsp; Possessed of more than a cursory knowledge of
astronomy, he took a sick man&rsquo;s pleasure in speculating as to
the dwellers on the unseen worlds of those incredibly remote suns, to
haunt whose houses of light, life came forth, a shy visitant, from the
rayless crypts of matter.&nbsp; He could no more apprehend limits to
time than bounds to space.&nbsp; No subversive radium speculations had
shaken his steady scientific faith in the conservation of energy and
the indestructibility of matter.&nbsp; Always and forever must there
have been stars.&nbsp; And surely, in that cosmic ferment, all must
be comparatively alike, comparatively of the same substance, or substances,
save for the freaks of the ferment.&nbsp; All must obey, or compose,
the same laws that ran without infraction through the entire experience
of man.&nbsp; Therefore, he argued and agreed, must worlds and life
be appanages to all the suns as they were appanages to the particular
of his own solar system.</p>
<p>Even as he lay here, under the breadfruit tree, an intelligence that
stared across the starry gulfs, so must all the universe be exposed
to the ceaseless scrutiny of innumerable eyes, like his, though grantedly
different, with behind them, by the same token, intelligences that questioned
and sought the meaning and the construction of the whole.&nbsp; So reasoning,
he felt his soul go forth in kinship with that august company, that
multitude whose gaze was forever upon the arras of infinity.</p>
<p>Who were they, what were they, those far distant and superior ones
who had bridged the sky with their gigantic, red-iridescent, heaven-singing
message?&nbsp; Surely, and long since, had they, too, trod the path
on which man had so recently, by the calendar of the cosmos, set his
feet.&nbsp; And to be able to send a message across the pit of space,
surely they had reached those heights to which man, in tears and travail
and bloody sweat, in darkness and confusion of many counsels, was so
slowly struggling.&nbsp; And what were they on their heights?&nbsp;
Had they won Brotherhood?&nbsp; Or had they learned that the law of
love imposed the penalty of weakness and decay?&nbsp; Was strife, life?&nbsp;
Was the rule of all the universe the pitiless rule of natural selection?&nbsp;
And, and most immediately and poignantly, were their far conclusions,
their long-won wisdoms, shut even then in the huge, metallic heart of
the Red One, waiting for the first earth-man to read?&nbsp; Of one thing
he was certain: No drop of red dew shaken from the lion-mane of some
sun in torment, was the sounding sphere.&nbsp; It was of design, not
chance, and it contained the speech and wisdom of the stars.</p>
<p>What engines and elements and mastered forces, what lore and mysteries
and destiny-controls, might be there!&nbsp; Undoubtedly, since so much
could be enclosed in so little a thing as the foundation stone of a
public building, this enormous sphere should contain vast histories,
profounds of research achieved beyond man&rsquo;s wildest guesses, laws
and formulae that, easily mastered, would make man&rsquo;s life on earth,
individual and collective, spring up from its present mire to inconceivable
heights of purity and power.&nbsp; It was Time&rsquo;s greatest gift
to blindfold, insatiable, and sky-aspiring man.&nbsp; And to him, Bassett,
had been vouchsafed the lordly fortune to be the first to receive this
message from man&rsquo;s interstellar kin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;No white man, much less no outland man of the other bush-tribes,
had gazed upon the Red One and lived.&nbsp; Such the law expounded by
Ngurn to Bassett.&nbsp; There was such a thing as blood brotherhood.&nbsp;
Bassett, in return, had often argued in the past.&nbsp; But Ngurn had
stated solemnly no.&nbsp; Even the blood brotherhood was outside the
favour of the Red One.&nbsp; Only a man born within the tribe could
look upon the Red One and live.&nbsp; But now, his guilty secret known
only to Balatta, whose fear of immolation before the Red One fast-sealed
her lips, the situation was different.&nbsp; What he had to do was to
recover from the abominable fevers that weakened him, and gain to civilization.&nbsp;
Then would he lead an expedition back, and, although the entire population
of Guadalcanal he destroyed, extract from the heart of the Red One the
message of the world from other worlds.</p>
<p>But Bassett&rsquo;s relapses grew more frequent, his brief convalescences
less and less vigorous, his periods of coma longer, until he came to
know, beyond the last promptings of the optimism inherent in so tremendous
a constitution as his own, that he would never live to cross the grass
lands, perforate the perilous coast jungle, and reach the sea.&nbsp;
He faded as the Southern Cross rose higher in the sky, till even Balatta
knew that he would be dead ere the nuptial date determined by his taboo.&nbsp;
Ngurn made pilgrimage personally and gathered the smoke materials for
the curing of Bassett&rsquo;s head, and to him made proud announcement
and exhibition of the artistic perfectness of his intention when Bassett
should be dead.&nbsp; As for himself, Bassett was not shocked.&nbsp;
Too long and too deeply had life ebbed down in him to bite him with
fear of its impending extinction.&nbsp; He continued to persist, alternating
periods of unconsciousness with periods of semi-consciousness, dreamy
and unreal, in which he idly wondered whether he had ever truly beheld
the Red One or whether it was a nightmare fancy of delirium.</p>
<p>Came the day when all mists and cob-webs dissolved, when he found
his brain clear as a bell, and took just appraisement of his body&rsquo;s
weakness.&nbsp; Neither hand nor foot could he lift.&nbsp; So little
control of his body did he have, that he was scarcely aware of possessing
one.&nbsp; Lightly indeed his flesh sat upon his soul, and his soul,
in its briefness of clarity, knew by its very clarity that the black
of cessation was near.&nbsp; He knew the end was close; knew that in
all truth he had with his eyes beheld the Red One, the messenger between
the worlds; knew that he would never live to carry that message to the
world - that message, for aught to the contrary, which might already
have waited man&rsquo;s hearing in the heart of Guadalcanal for ten
thousand years.&nbsp; And Bassett stirred with resolve, calling Ngurn
to him, out under the shade of the breadfruit tree, and with the old
devil-devil doctor discussing the terms and arrangements of his last
life effort, his final adventure in the quick of the flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the law, O Ngurn,&rdquo; he concluded the matter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whoso is not of the folk may not look upon the Red One and live.&nbsp;
I shall not live anyway.&nbsp; Your young men shall carry me before
the face of the Red One, and I shall look upon him, and hear his voice,
and thereupon die, under your hand, O Ngurn.&nbsp; Thus will the three
things be satisfied: the law, my desire, and your quicker possession
of my head for which all your preparations wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Ngurn consented, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better so.&nbsp; A sick man who cannot get well is foolish
to live on for so little a while.&nbsp; Also is it better for the living
that he should go.&nbsp; You have been much in the way of late.&nbsp;
Not but what it was good for me to talk to such a wise one.&nbsp; But
for moons of days we have held little talk.&nbsp; Instead, you have
taken up room in the house of heads, making noises like a dying pig,
or talking much and loudly in your own language which I do not understand.&nbsp;
This has been a confusion to me, for I like to think on the great things
of the light and dark as I turn the heads in the smoke.&nbsp; Your much
noise has thus been a disturbance to the long-learning and hatching
of the final wisdom that will be mine before I die.&nbsp; As for you,
upon whom the dark has already brooded, it is well that you die now.&nbsp;
And I promise you, in the long days to come when I turn your head in
the smoke, no man of the tribe shall come in to disturb us.&nbsp; And
I will tell you many secrets, for I am an old man and very wise, and
I shall be adding wisdom to wisdom as I turn your head in the smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a litter was made, and, borne on the shoulders of half a dozen
of the men, Bassett departed on the last little adventure that was to
cap the total adventure, for him, of living.&nbsp; With a body of which
he was scarcely aware, for even the pain had been exhausted out of it,
and with a bright clear brain that accommodated him to a quiet ecstasy
of sheer lucidness of thought, he lay back on the lurching litter and
watched the fading of the passing world, beholding for the last time
the breadfruit tree before the devil-devil house, the dim day beneath
the matted jungle roof, the gloomy gorge between the shouldering mountains,
the saddle of raw limestone, and the mesa of black volcanic sand.</p>
<p>Down the spiral path of the pit they bore him, encircling the sheening,
glowing Red One that seemed ever imminent to iridesce from colour and
light into sweet singing and thunder.&nbsp; And over bones and logs
of immolated men and gods they bore him, past the horrors of other immolated
ones that yet lived, to the three-king-post tripod and the huge king-post
striker.</p>
<p>Here Bassett, helped by Ngurn and Balatta, weakly sat up, swaying
weakly from the hips, and with clear, unfaltering, all-seeing eyes gazed
upon the Red One.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, O Ngurn,&rdquo; he said, not taking his eyes from the
sheening, vibrating surface whereon and wherein all the shades of cherry-red
played unceasingly, ever a-quiver to change into sound, to become silken
rustlings, silvery whisperings, golden thrummings of cords, velvet pipings
of elfland, mellow distances of thunderings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wait,&rdquo; Ngurn prompted after a long pause, the long-handled
tomahawk unassumingly ready in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, O Ngurn,&rdquo; Bassett repeated, &ldquo;let the Red
One speak so that I may see it speak as well as hear it.&nbsp; Then
strike, thus, when I raise my hand; for, when I raise my hand, I shall
drop my head forward and make place for the stroke at the base of my
neck.&nbsp; But, O Ngurn, I, who am about to pass out of the light of
day for ever, would like to pass with the wonder-voice of the Red One
singing greatly in my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I promise you that never will a head be so well cured
as yours,&rdquo; Ngurn assured him, at the same time signalling the
tribesmen to man the propelling ropes suspended from the king-post striker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your head shall be my greatest piece of work in the curing of
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassett smiled quietly to the old one&rsquo;s conceit, as the great
carved log, drawn back through two-score feet of space, was released.&nbsp;
The next moment he was lost in ecstasy at the abrupt and thunderous
liberation of sound.&nbsp; But such thunder!&nbsp; Mellow it was with
preciousness of all sounding metals.&nbsp; Archangels spoke in it; it
was magnificently beautiful before all other sounds; it was invested
with the intelligence of supermen of planets of other suns; it was the
voice of God, seducing and commanding to be heard.&nbsp; And - the everlasting
miracle of that interstellar metal! Bassett, with his own eyes, saw
colour and colours transform into sound till the whole visible surface
of the vast sphere was a-crawl and titillant and vaporous with what
he could not tell was colour or was sound.&nbsp; In that moment the
interstices of matter were his, and the interfusings and intermating
transfusings of matter and force.</p>
<p>Time passed.&nbsp; At the last Bassett was brought back from his
ecstasy by an impatient movement of Ngurn.&nbsp; He had quite forgotten
the old devil-devil one.&nbsp; A quick flash of fancy brought a husky
chuckle into Bassett&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; His shot-gun lay beside him
in the litter.&nbsp; All he had to do, muzzle to head, was to press
the trigger and blow his head into nothingness.</p>
<p>But why cheat him? was Bassett&rsquo;s next thought.&nbsp; Head-hunting,
cannibal beast of a human that was as much ape as human, nevertheless
Old Ngurn had, according to his lights, played squarer than square.&nbsp;
Ngurn was in himself a forerunner of ethics and contract, of consideration,
and gentleness in man.&nbsp; No, Bassett decided; it would be a ghastly
pity and an act of dishonour to cheat the old fellow at the last.&nbsp;
His head was Ngurn&rsquo;s, and Ngurn&rsquo;s head to cure it would
be.</p>
<p>And Bassett, raising his hand in signal, bending forward his head
as agreed so as to expose cleanly the articulation to his taut spinal
cord, forgot Balatta, who was merely a woman, a woman merely and only
and undesired.&nbsp; He knew, without seeing, when the razor-edged hatchet
rose in the air behind him.&nbsp; And for that instant, ere the end,
there fell upon Bassett the shadows of the Unknown, a sense of impending
marvel of the rending of walls before the imaginable.&nbsp; Almost,
when he knew the blow had started and just ere the edge of steel bit
the flesh and nerves it seemed that he gazed upon the serene face of
the Medusa, Truth - And, simultaneous with the bite of the steel on
the onrush of the dark, in a flashing instant of fancy, he saw the vision
of his head turning slowly, always turning, in the devil-devil house
beside the breadfruit tree.</p>

<h2>STORY: THE HUSSY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>There are some stories that have to be true - the sort that cannot
be fabricated by a ready fiction-reckoner.&nbsp; And by the same token
there are some men with stories to tell who cannot be doubted.&nbsp;
Such a man was Julian Jones.&nbsp; Although I doubt if the average reader
of this will believe the story Julian Jones told me.&nbsp; Nevertheless
I believe it.&nbsp; So thoroughly am I convinced of its verity that
I am willing, nay, eager, to invest capital in the enterprise and embark
personally on the adventure to a far land.</p>
<p>It was in the Australian Building at the Panama Pacific Exposition
that I met him.&nbsp; I was standing before an exhibit of facsimiles
of the record nuggets which had been discovered in the goldfields of
the Antipodes.&nbsp; Knobbed, misshapen and massive, it was as difficult
to believe that they were not real gold as it was to believe the accompanying
statistics of their weights and values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what those kangaroo-hunters call a nugget,&rdquo;
boomed over my shoulder directly at the largest of the specimens.</p>
<p>I turned and looked up into the dim blue eyes of Julian Jones.&nbsp;
I looked up, for he stood something like six feet four inches in height.&nbsp;
His hair, a wispy, sandy yellow, seemed as dimmed and faded as his eyes.&nbsp;
It may have been the sun which had washed out his colouring; at least
his face bore the evidence of a prodigious and ardent sun-burn which
had long since faded to yellow.&nbsp; As his eyes turned from the exhibit
and focussed on mine I noted a queer look in them as of one who vainly
tries to recall some fact of supreme importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it as a nugget?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I demanded.</p>
<p>The remote, indwelling expression went out of his eyes as he boomed</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, its size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem large,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
no doubt it&rsquo;s authentic.&nbsp; The Australian Government would
scarcely dare - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Large!&rdquo; he interrupted, with a sniff and a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Largest ever discovered - &rdquo; I started on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever discovered!&rdquo;&nbsp; His dim eyes smouldered hotly
as he proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think that every lump of gold ever
discovered has got into the newspapers and encyclopedias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied judicially, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s
one that hasn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re to know about
it.&nbsp; If a really big nugget, or nugget-finder, elects to blush
unseen - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he broke in quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
saw it with my own eyes, and, besides, I&rsquo;m too tanned to blush
anyway.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a railroad man and I&rsquo;ve been in the tropics
a lot.&nbsp; Why, I used to be the colour of mahogany - real old mahogany,
and have been taken for a blue-eyed Spaniard more than once - &rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my turn to interrupt, and I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that nugget bigger than those in there, Mr. - er - ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jones, Julian Jones is my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dug into an inner pocket and produced an envelope addressed to
such a person, care of General Delivery, San Francisco; and I, in turn,
presented him with my card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to know you, sir,&rdquo; he said, extending his hand,
his voice booming as if accustomed to loud noises or wide spaces.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve heard of you, seen your picture in the papers,
and all that, and, though I say it that shouldn&rsquo;t, I want to say
that I didn&rsquo;t care a rap about those articles you wrote on Mexico.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re wrong, all wrong.&nbsp; You make the mistake of all Gringos
in thinking a Mexican is a white man.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; None
of them ain&rsquo;t - Greasers, Spiggoties, Latin-Americans and all
the rest of the cattle.&nbsp; Why, sir, they don&rsquo;t think like
we think, or reason, or act.&nbsp; Even their multiplication table is
different.&nbsp; You think seven times seven is forty-nine; but not
them.&nbsp; They work it out different.&nbsp; And white isn&rsquo;t
white to them, either.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; Buying
coffee retail for house-keeping in one-pound or ten-pound lots - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big was that nugget you referred to?&rdquo; I queried
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As big as the biggest of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bigger,&rdquo; he said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bigger than the
whole blamed exhibit of them put together, and then some.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He paused and regarded me with a steadfast gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t go into the matter with you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a reputation a man ought to be able to trust, and I&rsquo;ve
read you&rsquo;ve done some tall skylarking yourself in out-of-the-way
places.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been browsing around with an eye open for some
one to go in with me on the proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>And here I am, blazing out into print with the whole story just as
he told it to me as we sat on a bench by the lagoon before the Palace
of Fine Arts with the cries of the sea gulls in our ears.&nbsp; Well,
he should have kept his appointment with me.&nbsp; But I anticipate.</p>
<p>As we started to leave the building and hunt for a seat, a small
woman, possibly thirty years of age, with a washed-out complexion of
the farmer&rsquo;s wife sort, darted up to him in a bird-like way, for
all the world like the darting veering gulls over our heads and fastened
herself to his arm with the accuracy and dispatch and inevitableness
of a piece of machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; she shrilled.&nbsp; &ldquo;A-trottin&rsquo;
right off and never givin&rsquo; me a thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was formally introduced to her.&nbsp; It was patent that she had
never heard of me, and she surveyed me bleakly with shrewd black eyes,
set close together and as beady and restless as a bird&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to tell him about that hussy?&rdquo;
she complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Sarah, this is business, you see,&rdquo; he argued
plaintively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; for a likely
man this long while, and now that he&rsquo;s shown up it seems to me
I got a right to give him the hang of what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small woman made no reply, but set her thin lips in a needle-like
line.&nbsp; She gazed straight before her at the Tower of Jewels with
so austere an expression that no glint of refracted sunlight could soften
it.&nbsp; We proceeded slowly to the lagoon, managed to obtain an unoccupied
seat, and sat down with mutual sighs of relief as we released our weights
from our tortured sightseeing feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One does get so mortal weary,&rdquo; asserted the small woman,
almost defiantly.</p>
<p>Two swans waddled up from the mirroring water and investigated us.&nbsp;
When their suspicions of our niggardliness or lack of peanuts had been
confirmed, Jones half-turned his back on his life-partner and gave me
his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever been in Ecuador?&nbsp; Then take my advice - and don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Though I take that back, for you and me might be hitting it for there
together if you can rustle up the faith in me and the backbone in yourself
for the trip.&nbsp; Well, anyway, it ain&rsquo;t so many years ago that
I came ambling in there on a rusty, foul-bottomed, tramp collier from
Australia, forty-three days from land to land.&nbsp; Seven knots was
her speed when everything favoured, and we&rsquo;d had a two weeks&rsquo;
gale to the north&rsquo;ard of New Zealand, and broke our engines down
for two days off Pitcairn Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was no sailor on her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a locomotive engineer.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;d made friends with the skipper at Newcastle an&rsquo; come
along as his guest for as far as Guayaquil.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;d
heard wages was &rsquo;way up on the American railroad runnin&rsquo;
from that place over the Andes to Quito.&nbsp; Now Guayaquil - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a fever-hole,&rdquo; I interpolated.</p>
<p>Julian Jones nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Nast died there of it within a month after he landed.
- He was our great American cartoonist,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; Julian Jones said shortly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I do know he wasn&rsquo;t the first to pass out by a long
shot.&nbsp; Why, look you the way I found it.&nbsp; The pilot grounds
is sixty miles down the river.&nbsp; &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the fever?&rsquo;
said I to the pilot who came aboard in the early morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;See
that Hamburg barque,&rsquo; said he, pointing to a sizable ship at anchor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Captain and fourteen men dead of it already, and the cook and
two men dying right now, and they&rsquo;re the last left of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by jinks he told the truth.&nbsp; And right then they
were dying forty a day in Guayaquil of Yellow Jack.&nbsp; But that was
nothing, as I was to find out.&nbsp; Bubonic plague and small-pox were
raging, while dysentery and pneumonia were reducing the population,
and the railroad was raging worst of all.&nbsp; I mean that.&nbsp; For
them that insisted in riding on it, it was more dangerous than all the
other diseases put together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we dropped anchor off Guayaquil half a dozen skippers
from other steamers came on board to warn our skipper not to let any
of his crew or officers go ashore except the ones he wanted to lose.&nbsp;
A launch came off for me from Duran, which is on the other side of the
river and is the terminal of the railroad.&nbsp; And it brought off
a man that soared up the gangway three jumps at a time he was that eager
to get aboard.&nbsp; When he hit the deck he hadn&rsquo;t time to speak
to any of us.&nbsp; He just leaned out over the rail and shook his fist
at Duran and shouted: &lsquo;I beat you to it!&nbsp; I beat you to it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;d you beat to it, friend?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The railroad,&rsquo; he said, as he unbuckled the straps and
took off a big &rsquo;44 Colt&rsquo;s automatic from where he wore it
handy on his left side under his coat, &lsquo;I staved as long as I
agreed - three months - and it didn&rsquo;t get me.&nbsp; I was a conductor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the railroad I was to work for.&nbsp; All of
which was nothing to what he told me in the next few minutes.&nbsp;
The road ran from sea level at Duran up to twelve thousand feet on Chimborazo
and down to ten thousand at Quito on the other side the range.&nbsp;
And it was so dangerous that the trains didn&rsquo;t run nights.&nbsp;
The through passengers had to get off and sleep in the towns at night
while the train waited for daylight.&nbsp; And each train carried a
guard of Ecuadoriano soldiers which was the most dangerous of all.&nbsp;
They were supposed to protect the train crews, but whenever trouble
started they unlimbered their rifles and joined the mob.&nbsp; You see,
whenever a train wreck occurred, the first cry of the spiggoties was
&lsquo;Kill the Gringos!&rsquo;&nbsp; They always did that, and proceeded
to kill the train crew and whatever chance Gringo passengers that&rsquo;d
escaped being killed in the accident.&nbsp; Which is their kind of arithmetic,
which I told you a while back as being different from ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&nbsp; Before the day was out I was to find out for
myself that that ex-conductor wasn&rsquo;t lying.&nbsp; It was over
at Duran.&nbsp; I was to take my run on the first division out to Quito,
for which place I was to start next morning - only one through train
running every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; It was the afternoon of my first
day, along about four o&rsquo;clock, when the boilers of the <i>Governor
Hancock</i> exploded and she sank in sixty feet of water alongside the
dock.&nbsp; She was the big ferry boat that carried the railroad passengers
across the river to Guayaquil.&nbsp; It was a bad accident, but it was
the cause of worse that followed.&nbsp; By half-past four, big trainloads
began to arrive.&nbsp; It was a feast day and they&rsquo;d run an excursion
up country but of Guayaquil, and this was the crowd coming back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the crowd - there was five thousand of them - wanted to
get ferried across, and the ferry was at the bottom of the river, which
wasn&rsquo;t our fault.&nbsp; But by the Spiggoty arithmetic, it was.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Kill the Gringos!&rsquo; shouts one of them.&nbsp; And right
there the beans were spilled.&nbsp; Most of us got away by the skin
of our teeth.&nbsp; I raced on the heels of the Master Mechanic, carrying
one of his babies for him, for the locomotives that was just pulling
out.&nbsp; You see, way down there away from everywhere they just got
to save their locomotives in times of trouble, because, without them,
a railroad can&rsquo;t be run.&nbsp; Half a dozen American wives and
as many children were crouching on the cab floors along with the rest
of us when we pulled out; and the Ecuadoriano soldiers, who should have
been protecting our lives and property, turned loose with their rifles
and must have given us all of a thousand rounds before we got out of
range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We camped up country and didn&rsquo;t come back to clean up
until next day.&nbsp; It was some cleaning.&nbsp; Every flat-car, box-car,
coach, asthmatic switch engine, and even hand-car that mob of Spiggoties
had shoved off the dock into sixty feet of water on top of the <i>Governor
Hancock</i>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d burnt the round house, set fire to the
coal bunkers, and made a scandal of the repair shops.&nbsp; Oh, yes,
and there were three of our fellows they&rsquo;d got that we had to
bury mighty quick.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hot weather all the time down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian Jones came to a full pause and over his shoulder studied the
straight-before-her gaze and forbidding expression of his wife&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t forgotten the nugget,&rdquo; he assured me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor the hussy,&rdquo; the little woman snapped, apparently
at the mud-hens paddling on the surface of the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been travelling toward the nugget right along -
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was never no reason for you to stay in that dangerous
country,&rdquo; his wife snapped in on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sarah,&rdquo; he appealed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was working
for you right along.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to me he explained: &ldquo;The
risk was big, but so was the pay.&nbsp; Some months I earned as high
as five hundred gold.&nbsp; And here was Sarah waiting for me back in
Nebraska - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; us engaged two years,&rdquo; she complained to the
Tower of Jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo; - What of the strike, and me being blacklisted, and getting
typhoid down in Australia, and everything,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And luck was with me on that railroad.&nbsp; Why, I saw fellows
fresh from the States pass out, some of them not a week on their first
run.&nbsp; If the diseases and the railroad didn&rsquo;t get them, then
it was the Spiggoties got them.&nbsp; But it just wasn&rsquo;t my fate,
even that time I rode my engine down to the bottom of a forty-foot washout.&nbsp;
I lost my fireman; and the conductor and the Superintendent of Rolling
Stock (who happened to be running down to Duran to meet his bride) had
their heads knifed off by the Spiggoties and paraded around on poles.&nbsp;
But I lay snug as a bug under a couple of feet of tender coal, and they
thought I&rsquo;d headed for tall timber - lay there a day and a night
till the excitement cooled down.&nbsp; Yes, I was lucky.&nbsp; The worst
that happened to me was I caught a cold once, and another time had a
carbuncle.&nbsp; But the other fellows!&nbsp; They died like flies,
what of Yellow Jack, pneumonia, the Spiggoties, and the railroad.&nbsp;
The trouble was I didn&rsquo;t have much chance to pal with them.&nbsp;
No sooner&rsquo;d I get some intimate with one of them he&rsquo;d up
and die - all but a fireman named Andrews, and he went loco for keeps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made good on my job from the first, and lived in Quito in
a &rsquo;dobe house with whacking big Spanish tiles on the roof that
I&rsquo;d rented.&nbsp; And I never had much trouble with the Spiggoties,
what of letting them sneak free rides in the tender or on the cowcatcher.&nbsp;
Me throw them off?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; I took notice, when Jack Harris
put off a bunch of them, that I attended his funeral <i>muy</i> <i>pronto</i>
- &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak English,&rdquo; the little woman beside him snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah just can&rsquo;t bear to tolerate me speaking Spanish,&rdquo;
he apologized.&nbsp; &ldquo;It gets so on her nerves that I promised
not to.&nbsp; Well, as I was saying, the goose hung high and everything
was going hunky-dory, and I was piling up my wages to come north to
Nebraska and marry Sarah, when I run on to Vahna - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; Sarah hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sarah,&rdquo; her towering giant of a husband begged,
&ldquo;I just got to mention her or I can&rsquo;t tell about the nugget.
- It was one night when I was taking a locomotive - no train - down
to Amato, about thirty miles from Quito.&nbsp; Seth Manners was my fireman.&nbsp;
I was breaking him in to engineer for himself, and I was letting him
run the locomotive while I sat up in his seat meditating about Sarah
here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d just got a letter from her, begging as usual for
me to come home and hinting as usual about the dangers of an unmarried
man like me running around loose in a country full of senoritas and
fandangos.&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; If she could only a-seen them.&nbsp; Positive
frights, that&rsquo;s what they are, their faces painted white as corpses
and their lips red as - as some of the train wrecks I&rsquo;ve helped
clean up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lovely April night, not a breath of wind, and a tremendous
big moon shining right over the top of Chimborazo. - Some mountain that.&nbsp;
The railroad skirted it twelve thousand feet above sea level, and the
top of it ten thousand feet higher than that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe I was drowsing, with Seth running the engine; but he
slammed on the brakes so sudden hard that I darn near went through the
cab window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What the - &rsquo; I started to yell, and &lsquo;Holy
hell,&rsquo; Seth says, as both of us looked at what was on the track.&nbsp;
And I agreed with Seth entirely in his remark.&nbsp; It was an Indian
girl - and take it from me, Indians ain&rsquo;t Spiggoties by any manner
of means.&nbsp; Seth had managed to fetch a stop within twenty feet
of her, and us bowling down hill at that!&nbsp; But the girl.&nbsp;
She - &rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the form of Mrs. Julian Jones stiffen, although she kept her
gaze fixed balefully upon two mud-hens that were prowling along the
lagoon shallows below us.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; she hissed,
once and implacably.&nbsp; Jones had stopped at the sound, but went
on immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a tall girl, slim and slender, you know the kind,
with black hair, remarkably long hanging, down loose behind her, as
she stood there no more afraid than nothing, her arms spread out to
stop the engine.&nbsp; She was wearing a slimpsy sort of garment wrapped
around her that wasn&rsquo;t cloth but ocelot skins, soft and dappled,
and silky.&nbsp; It was all she had on - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>But Mr. Jones went on, making believe that he was unaware of the
interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hell of a way to stop a locomotive,&rsquo; I complained
at Seth, as I climbed down on to the right of way.&nbsp; I walked past
our engine and up to the girl, and what do you think?&nbsp; Her eyes
were shut tight.&nbsp; She was trembling that violent that you would
see it by the moonlight.&nbsp; And she was barefoot, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rsquo; I said, none too gentle.&nbsp;
She gave a start, seemed to come out of her trance, and opened her eyes.&nbsp;
Say!&nbsp; They were big and black and beautiful.&nbsp; Believe me,
she was some looker - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo;&nbsp; At which hiss the two mud-hens veered
away a few feet.&nbsp; But Jones was getting himself in hand, and didn&rsquo;t
even blink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you stopping this locomotive for?&rsquo; I
demanded in Spanish.&nbsp; Nary an answer.&nbsp; She stared at me, then
at the snorting engine and then burst into tears, which you&rsquo;ll
admit is uncommon behaviour for an Indian woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you try to get rides that way,&rsquo; I slung at
her in Spiggoty Spanish (which they tell me is some different from regular
Spanish), &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll be taking one smeared all over our cowcatcher
and headlight, and it&rsquo;ll be up to my fireman to scrape you off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Spiggoty Spanish wasn&rsquo;t much to brag on, but I could
see she understood, though she only shook her head and wouldn&rsquo;t
speak.&nbsp; But great Moses, she was some looker - &rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced apprehensively at Mrs. Jones, who must have caught me out
of the tail of her eye, for she muttered: &ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t
been do you think he&rsquo;d a-taken her into his house to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hold on, Sarah,&rdquo; he protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
ain&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;m telling this. - Next thing,
Seth yells at me, &lsquo;Goin&rsquo; to stay here all night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; I said to the girl, &lsquo;and climb
on board.&nbsp; But next time you want a ride don&rsquo;t flag a locomotive
between stations.&rsquo;&nbsp; She followed along; but when I got to
the step and turned to give her a lift-up, she wasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;
I went forward again.&nbsp; Not a sign of her.&nbsp; Above and below
was sheer cliff, and the track stretched ahead a hundred yards clear
and empty.&nbsp; And then I spotted her, crouched down right against
the cowcatcher, that close I&rsquo;d almost stepped on her.&nbsp; If
we&rsquo;d started up, we&rsquo;d have run over her in a second.&nbsp;
It was all so nonsensical, I never could make out her actions.&nbsp;
Maybe she was trying to suicide.&nbsp; I grabbed her by the wrist and
jerked her none too gentle to her feet.&nbsp; And she came along all
right.&nbsp; Women do know when a man means business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced from this Goliath to his little, bird-eyed spouse, and
wondered if he had ever tried to mean business with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seth kicked at first, but I boosted her into the cab and made
her sit up beside me - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose Seth was busy running the engine,&rdquo; Mrs.
Jones observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was breaking him in, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Jones
protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;So we made the run into Amato.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
never opened her mouth once, and no sooner&rsquo;d the engine stopped
than she&rsquo;d jumped to the ground and was gone.&nbsp; Just like
that.&nbsp; Not a thank you kindly.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But next morning when we came to pull out for Quito with a
dozen flat cars loaded with rails, there she was in the cab waiting
for us; and in the daylight I could see how much better a looker she
was than the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Huh! she&rsquo;s adopted you,&rsquo; Seth grins.&nbsp;
And it looked like it.&nbsp; She just stood there and looked at me -
at us - like a loving hound dog that you love, that you&rsquo;ve caught
with a string of sausages inside of him, and that just knows you ain&rsquo;t
going to lift a hand to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go chase yourself!&rsquo;
I told her <i>pronto</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Mrs. Jones her proximity noticeable
with a wince at the Spanish word.)&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Sarah, I&rsquo;d
no use for her, even at the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones stiffened.&nbsp; Her lips moved soundlessly, but I knew
to what syllables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made it hardest was Seth jeering at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
can&rsquo;t shake her that way,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You saved
her life - &rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I said sharply;
&lsquo;it was you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But she thinks you did, which
is the same thing,&rsquo; he came back at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now she
belongs to you.&nbsp; Custom of the country, as you ought to know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathenish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones, and though her steady
gaze was set upon the Tower of Jewels I knew she was making no reference
to its architecture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s come to do light housekeeping for you,&rsquo;
Seth grinned.&nbsp; I let him rave, though afterwards I kept him throwing
in the coal too fast to work his mouth very much.&nbsp; Why, say, when
I got to the spot where I picked her up, and stopped the train for her
to get off, she just flopped down on her knees, got a hammerlock with
her arms around my knees, and cried all over my shoes.&nbsp; What was
I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no perceptible movement that I was aware of, Mrs. Jones advertised
her certitude of knowledge of what <i>she</i> would have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the moment we pulled into Quito, she did what she&rsquo;d
done before - vanished.&nbsp; Sarah never believes me when I say how
relieved I felt to be quit of her.&nbsp; But it was not to be.&nbsp;
I got to my &rsquo;dobe house and managed a cracking fine dinner my
cook had ready for me.&nbsp; She was mostly Spiggoty and half Indian,
and her name was Paloma. - Now, Sarah, haven&rsquo;t I told you she
was older&rsquo;n a grandmother, and looked more like a buzzard than
a dove?&nbsp; Why, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to eat with her around where
I could look at her.&nbsp; But she did make things comfortable, and
she was some economical when it came to marketing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That afternoon, after a big long siesta, what&rsquo;d I find
in the kitchen, just as much at home as if she belonged there, but that
blamed Indian girl.&nbsp; And old Paloma was squatting at the girl&rsquo;s
feet and rubbing the girl&rsquo;s knees and legs like for rheumatism,
which I knew the girl didn&rsquo;t have from the way I&rsquo;d sized
up the walk of her, and keeping time to the rubbing with a funny sort
of gibberish chant.&nbsp; And I let loose right there and then.&nbsp;
As Sarah knows, I never could a-bear women around the house - young,
unmarried women, I mean.&nbsp; But it was no go!&nbsp; Old Paloma sided
with the girl, and said if the girl went she went, too.&nbsp; Also,
she called me more kinds of a fool than the English language has accommodation
for.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d like the Spanish lingo, Sarah, for expressing
yourself in such ways, and you&rsquo;d have liked old Paloma, too.&nbsp;
She was a good woman, though she didn&rsquo;t have any teeth and her
face could kill a strong man&rsquo;s appetite in the cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave in.&nbsp; I had to.&nbsp; Except for the excuse that
she needed Vahna&rsquo;s help around the house (which she didn&rsquo;t
at all), old Paloma never said why she stuck up for the girl.&nbsp;
Anyway, Vahna was a quiet thing, never in the way.&nbsp; And she never
gadded.&nbsp; Just sat in-doors jabbering with Paloma and helping with
the chores.&nbsp; But I wasn&rsquo;t long in getting on to that she
was afraid of something.&nbsp; She would look up, that anxious it hurt,
whenever anybody called, like some of the boys to have a gas or a game
of pedro.&nbsp; I tried to worm it out of Paloma what was worrying the
girl, but all the old woman did was to look solemn and shake her head
like all the devils in hell was liable to precipitate a visit on us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then one day Vahna had a visitor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d just
come in from a run and was passing the time of day with her - I had
to be polite, even if she had butted in on me and come to live in my
house for keeps - when I saw a queer expression come into her eyes.&nbsp;
In the doorway stood an Indian boy.&nbsp; He looked like her, but was
younger and slimmer.&nbsp; She took him into the kitchen and they must
have had a great palaver, for he didn&rsquo;t leave until after dark.&nbsp;
Inside the week he came back, but I missed him.&nbsp; When I got home,
Paloma put a fat nugget of gold into my hand, which Vahna had sent him
for.&nbsp; The blamed thing weighed all of two pounds and was worth
more than five hundred dollars.&nbsp; She explained that Vahna wanted
me to take it to pay for her keep.&nbsp; And I had to take it to keep
peace in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, after a long time, came another visitor.&nbsp; We were
sitting before the fire - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him and the hussy,&rdquo; quoth Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Paloma,&rdquo; he added quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him and his cook and his light housekeeper sitting by the
fire,&rdquo; she amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I admit Vahna did like me a whole heap,&rdquo; he asserted
recklessly, then modified with a pang of caution: &ldquo;A heap more
than was good for her, seeing that I had no inclination her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, she had another visitor.&nbsp; He was
a lean, tall, white-headed old Indian, with a beak on him like an eagle.&nbsp;
He walked right in without knocking.&nbsp; Vahna gave a little cry that
was half like a yelp and half like a gasp, and flumped down on her knees
before me, pleading to me with deer&rsquo;s eyes and to him with the
eyes of a deer about to be killed that don&rsquo;t want to be killed.&nbsp;
Then, for a minute that seemed as long as a life-time, she and the old
fellow glared at each other.&nbsp; Paloma was the first to talk, in
his own lingo, for he talked back to her.&nbsp; But great Moses, if
he wasn&rsquo;t the high and mighty one!&nbsp; Paloma&rsquo;s old knees
were shaking, and she cringed to him like a hound dog.&nbsp; And all
this in my own house!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have thrown him out on his neck,
only he was so old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the things he said to Vahna were as terrible as the way
he looked!&nbsp; Say!&nbsp; He just spit words at her!&nbsp; But Paloma
kept whimpering and butting in, till something she said got across,
because his face relaxed.&nbsp; He condescended to give me the once
over and fired some question at Vahna.&nbsp; She hung her head, and
looked foolish, and blushed, and then replied with a single word and
a shake of the head.&nbsp; And with that he just naturally turned on
his heel and beat it.&nbsp; I guess she&rsquo;d said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some time after that Vahna used to fluster up whenever
she saw me.&nbsp; Then she took to the kitchen for a spell.&nbsp; But
after a long time she began hanging around the big room again.&nbsp;
She was still mighty shy, but she&rsquo;d keep on following me about
with those big eyes of hers - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; I heard plainly.&nbsp; But Julian Jones
and I were pretty well used to it by this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I was getting some interested
myself - oh, not in the way Sarah never lets up letting me know she
thinks.&nbsp; That two-pound nugget was what had me going.&nbsp; If
Vahna&rsquo;d put me wise to where it came from, I could say good-bye
to railroading and hit the high places for Nebraska and Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the beans were spilled . . . by accident.&nbsp; Come
a letter from Wisconsin.&nbsp; My Aunt Eliza &rsquo;d died and up and
left me her big farm.&nbsp; I let out a whoop when I read it; but I
could have canned my joy, for I was jobbed out of it by the courts and
lawyers afterward - not a cent to me, and I&rsquo;m still paying &rsquo;m
in instalments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know, then; and I prepared to pull back
to God&rsquo;s country.&nbsp; Paloma got sore, and Vahna got the weeps.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go!&rsquo;&nbsp; That was her
song.&nbsp; But I gave notice on my job, and wrote a letter to Sarah
here - didn&rsquo;t I, Sarah?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night, sitting by the fire like at a funeral, Vahna really
loosened up for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; she says to me, with old Paloma
nodding agreement with her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you where my
brother got the nugget, if you don&rsquo;t go.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Too
late,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; And I told her why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And told her about me waiting for you back in Nebraska,&rdquo;
Mrs. Jones observed in cold, passionless tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sarah, why should I hurt a poor Indian girl&rsquo;s feelings?&nbsp;
Of course I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she and Paloma talked Indian some more, and then Vahna
says: &lsquo;If you stay, I&rsquo;ll show you the biggest nugget that
is the father of all other nuggets.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How big?&rsquo;
I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;As big as me?&rsquo;&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bigger than you,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;much, much bigger.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t grow that way,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; But she
said she&rsquo;d seen it and Paloma backed her up.&nbsp; Why, to listen
to them you&rsquo;d have thought there was millions in that one nugget.&nbsp;
Paloma &rsquo;d never seen it herself, but she&rsquo;d heard about it.&nbsp;
A secret of the tribe which she couldn&rsquo;t share, being only half
Indian herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian Jones paused and heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they kept on insisting until I fell for - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hussy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones, pert as a bird, at the
ready instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; for the nugget.&nbsp; What of Aunt Eliza&rsquo;s
farm I was rich enough to quit railroading, but not rich enough to turn
my back on big money - and I just couldn&rsquo;t help believing them
two women.&nbsp; Gee!&nbsp; I could be another Vanderbilt, or J. P.
Morgan.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way I thought; and I started in to pump
Vahna.&nbsp; But she wouldn&rsquo;t give down.&nbsp; &lsquo;You come
along with me,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can be back here in
a couple of weeks with all the gold the both of us can carry.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take a burro, or a pack-train of burros,&rsquo; was
my suggestion.&nbsp; But nothing doing.&nbsp; And Paloma agreed with
her.&nbsp; It was too dangerous.&nbsp; The Indians would catch us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two of us pulled out when the nights were moonlight.&nbsp;
We travelled only at night, and laid up in the days.&nbsp; Vahna wouldn&rsquo;t
let me light a fire, and I missed my coffee something fierce.&nbsp;
We got up in the real high mountains of the main Andes, where the snow
on one pass gave us some trouble; but the girl knew the trails, and,
though we didn&rsquo;t waste any time, we were a full week getting there.&nbsp;
I know the general trend of our travel, because I carried a pocket compass;
and the general trend is all I need to get there again, because of that
peak.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no mistaking it.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t another
peak like it in the world.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m not telling you its
particular shape, but when you and I head out for it from Quito I&rsquo;ll
take you straight to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no easy thing to climb, and the person doesn&rsquo;t
live that can climb it at night.&nbsp; We had to take the daylight to
it, and didn&rsquo;t reach the top till after sunset.&nbsp; Why, I could
take hours and hours telling you about that last climb, which I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
The top was flat as a billiard table, about a quarter of an acre in
size, and was almost clean of snow.&nbsp; Vahna told me that the great
winds that usually blew, kept the snow off of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were winded, and I got mountain sickness so bad that I
had to stretch out for a spell.&nbsp; Then, when the moon come up, I
took a prowl around.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t take long, and I didn&rsquo;t
catch a sight or a smell of anything that looked like gold.&nbsp; And
when I asked Vahna, she only laughed and clapped her hands.&nbsp; Meantime
my mountain sickness tuned up something fierce, and I sat down on a
big rock to wait for it to ease down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come on, now,&rsquo; I said, when I felt better.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stop your fooling and tell me where that nugget is.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearer to you right now than I&rsquo;ll ever get,&rsquo;
she answered, her big eyes going sudden wistful.&nbsp; &lsquo;All you
Gringos are alike.&nbsp; Gold is the love of your heart, and women don&rsquo;t
count much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; That was no time to tell
her about Sarah here.&nbsp; But Vahna seemed to shake off her depressed
feelings, and began to laugh and tease again.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you
like it?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like what?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
nugget you&rsquo;re sitting on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jumped up as though it was a red-hot stove.&nbsp; And all
it was was a rock.&nbsp; I felt nay heart sink.&nbsp; Either she had
gone clean loco or this was her idea of a joke.&nbsp; Wrong on both
counts.&nbsp; She gave me the hatchet and told me to take a hack at
the boulder, which I did, again and again, for yellow spots sprang up
from under every blow.&nbsp; By the great Moses! it was gold!&nbsp;
The whole blamed boulder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones rose suddenly to his full height and flung out his long arms,
his face turned to the southern skies.&nbsp; The movement shot panic
into the heart of a swan that had drawn nearer with amiably predatory
designs.&nbsp; Its consequent abrupt retreat collided it with a stout
old lady, who squealed and dropped her bag of peanuts.&nbsp; Jones sat
down and resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, I tell you, solid gold and that pure and soft that I
chopped chips out of it.&nbsp; It had been coated with some sort of
rain-proof paint or lacquer made out of asphalt or something.&nbsp;
No wonder I&rsquo;d taken it for a rock.&nbsp; It was ten feet long,
all of five feet through, and tapering to both ends like an egg.&nbsp;
Here.&nbsp; Take a look at this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his pocket he drew and opened a leather case, from which he
took an object wrapped in tissue-paper.&nbsp; Unwrapping it, he dropped
into my hand a chip of pure soft gold, the size of a ten-dollar gold-piece.&nbsp;
I could make out the greyish substance on one side with which it had
been painted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I chopped that from one end of the thing,&rdquo; Jones went
on, replacing the chip in its paper and leather case.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
lucky I put it in my pocket.&nbsp; For right at my back came one loud
word - more like a croak than a word, in my way of thinking.&nbsp; And
there was that lean old fellow with the eagle beak that had dropped
in on us one night.&nbsp; And there was about thirty Indians with him
- all slim young fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vahna&rsquo;d flopped down and begun whimpering, but I told
her, &lsquo;Get up and make friends with them for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
no,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is death.&nbsp; Good-bye, <i>amigo</i>
- &rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Jones winced, and her husband abruptly checked the particular
flow of his narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then get up and fight along with me,&rsquo; I said
to her.&nbsp; And she did.&nbsp; She was some hellion, there on the
top of the world, clawing and scratching tooth and nail - a regular
she cat.&nbsp; And I wasn&rsquo;t idle, though all I had was that hatchet
and my long arms.&nbsp; But they were too many for me, and there was
no place for me to put my back against a wall.&nbsp; When I come to,
minutes after they&rsquo;d cracked me on the head - here, feel this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing his hat, Julian Jones guided my finger tips through his
thatch of sandy hair until they sank into an indentation.&nbsp; It was
fully three inches long, and went into the bone itself of the skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I come to, there was Vahna spread-eagled on top of the
nugget, and the old fellow with a beak jabbering away solemnly as if
going through some sort of religious exercises.&nbsp; In his hand he
had a stone knife - you know, a thin, sharp sliver of some obsidian-like
stuff same as they make arrow-heads out of.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t lift
a hand, being held down, and being too weak besides.&nbsp; And - well,
anyway, that stone knife did for her, and me they didn&rsquo;t even
do the honour of killing there on top their sacred peak.&nbsp; They
chucked me off of it like so much carrion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the buzzards didn&rsquo;t get me either.&nbsp; I can see
the moonlight yet, shining on all those peaks of snow, as I went down.&nbsp;
Why, sir, it was a five-hundred-foot fall, only I didn&rsquo;t make
it.&nbsp; I went into a big snow-drift in a crevice.&nbsp; And when
I come to (hours after I know, for it was full day when I next saw the
sun), I found myself in a regular snow-cave or tunnel caused by the
water from the melting snow running along the ledge.&nbsp; In fact,
the stone above actually overhung just beyond where I first landed.&nbsp;
A few feet more to the side, either way, and I&rsquo;d almost be going
yet.&nbsp; It was a straight miracle, that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I paid for it.&nbsp; It was two years and over before
I knew what happened.&nbsp; All I knew was that I was Julian Jones and
that I&rsquo;d been blacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married
to Sarah here.&nbsp; I mean that.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know anything
in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains
in the head.&nbsp; I mean my head was queer, and I knew it was queer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, sitting on the porch of her father&rsquo;s farmhouse
back in Nebraska one moonlight evening, Sarah came out and put that
gold chip into my hand.&nbsp; Seems she&rsquo;d just found it in the
torn lining of the trunk I&rsquo;d brought back from Ecuador - I who
for two years didn&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;d been to Ecuador, or Australia,
or anything!&nbsp; Well, I just sat there looking at the chip in the
moonlight, and turning it over and over and figuring what it was and
where it&rsquo;d come from, when all of a sudden there was a snap inside
my head as if something had broken, and then I could see Vahna spread-eagled
on that big nugget and the old fellow with the beak waving the stone
knife, and . . . and everything.&nbsp; That is, everything that had
happened from the time I first left Nebraska to when I crawled to the
daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off the mountain-top.&nbsp;
But everything that&rsquo;d happened after that I&rsquo;d clean forgotten.&nbsp;
When Sarah said I was her husband, I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her.&nbsp;
Took all her family and the preacher that&rsquo;d married us to convince
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on I wrote to Seth Manners.&nbsp; The railroad hadn&rsquo;t
killed him yet, and he pieced out a lot for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll show
you his letters.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got them at the hotel.&nbsp; One day,
he said, making his regular run, I crawled out on to the track.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t stand upright, I just crawled.&nbsp; He took me for a
calf, or a big dog, at first.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t anything human, he
said, and I didn&rsquo;t know him or anything.&nbsp; As near as I can
make out, it was ten days after the mountain-top to the time Seth picked
me up.&nbsp; What I ate I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I didn&rsquo;t
eat.&nbsp; Then it was doctors at Quito, and Paloma nursing me (she
must have packed that gold chip in my trunk), until they found out I
was a man without a mind, and the railroad sent me back to Nebraska.&nbsp;
At any rate, that&rsquo;s what Seth writes me.&nbsp; Of myself, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; But Sarah here knows.&nbsp; She corresponded with the railroad
before they shipped me and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones nodded affirmation of his words, sighed and evidenced
unmistakable signs of eagerness to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been able to work since,&rdquo; her husband
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I ain&rsquo;t been able to figure out how
to get back that big nugget.&nbsp; Sarah&rsquo;s got money of her own,
and she won&rsquo;t let go a penny - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get down to <i>that</i> country no more!&rdquo;
she broke forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sarah, Vahna&rsquo;s dead - you know that,&rdquo; Julian
Jones protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about anything,&rdquo; she answered
decisively, &ldquo;except that <i>that</i> country is no place for a
married man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips snapped together, and she fixed an unseeing stare across
to where the afternoon sun was beginning to glow into sunset.&nbsp;
I gazed for a moment at her face, white, plump, tiny, and implacable,
and gave her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for such a mass of gold being there?&rdquo;
I queried of Julian Jones.&nbsp; &ldquo;A solid-gold meteor that fell
out of the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;
It was carried there by the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up a mountain like that - and such enormous weight and size!&rdquo;
I objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as easy,&rdquo; he smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to be
stumped by that proposition myself, after I got my memory back.&nbsp;
Now how in Sam Hill - &rsquo; I used to begin, and then spend hours
figuring at it.&nbsp; And then when I got the answer I felt downright
idiotic, it was that easy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused, then announced: &ldquo;They
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you just - said they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did and they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was his enigmatic reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course they never carried that monster nugget up there.&nbsp;
What they did was to carry up its contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited until he saw enlightenment dawn in my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then of course melted all the gold, or welded it, or smelted
it, all into one piece.&nbsp; You know the first Spaniards down there,
under a leader named Pizarro, were a gang of robbers and cut-throats.&nbsp;
They went through the country like the hoof-and-mouth disease, and killed
the Indians off like cattle.&nbsp; You see, the Indians had lots of
gold.&nbsp; Well, what the Spaniards didn&rsquo;t get, the surviving
Indians hid away in that one big chunk on top the mountain, and it&rsquo;s
been waiting there ever since for me - and for you, if you want to go
in on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here, by the Lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts, ended my acquaintance
with Julian Jones.&nbsp; On my agreeing to finance the adventure, he
promised to call on me at my hotel next morning with the letters of
Seth Manners and the railroad, and conclude arrangements.&nbsp; But
he did not call.&nbsp; That evening I telephoned his hotel and was informed
by the clerk that Mr. Julian Jones and wife had departed in the early
afternoon, with their baggage.</p>
<p>Can Mrs. Jones have rushed him back and hidden him away in Nebraska?&nbsp;
I remember that as we said good-bye, there was that in her smile that
recalled the vulpine complacency of Mona Lisa, the Wise.</p>
<p>Kohala, Hawaii,<br /><i>May</i> 5, 1916.</p>

<h2>STORY: LIKE ARGUS OF THE ANCIENT TIMES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was the summer of 1897, and there was trouble in the Tarwater
family.&nbsp; Grandfather Tarwater, after remaining properly subdued
and crushed for a quiet decade, had broken out again.&nbsp; This time
it was the Klondike fever.&nbsp; His first and one unvarying symptom
of such attacks was song.&nbsp; One chant only he raised, though he
remembered no more than the first stanza and but three lines of that.&nbsp;
And the family knew his feet were itching and his brain was tingling
with the old madness, when he lifted his hoarse-cracked voice, now falsetto-cracked,
in:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Like Argus of the ancient times,<br />We leave this modern Greece,<br />Tum-tum,
tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,<br />To shear the Golden Fleece.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ten years earlier he had lifted the chant, sung to the air of the
&ldquo;Doxology,&rdquo; when afflicted with the fever to go gold-mining
in Patagonia.&nbsp; The multitudinous family had sat upon him, but had
had a hard time doing it.&nbsp; When all else had failed to shake his
resolution, they had applied lawyers to him, with the threat of getting
out guardianship papers and of confining him in the state asylum for
the insane - which was reasonable for a man who had, a quarter of a
century before, speculated away all but ten meagre acres of a California
principality, and who had displayed no better business acumen ever since.</p>
<p>The application of lawyers to John Tarwater was like the application
of a mustard plaster.&nbsp; For, in his judgment, they were the gentry,
more than any other, who had skinned him out of the broad Tarwater acres.&nbsp;
So, at the time of his Patagonian fever, the very thought of so drastic
a remedy was sufficient to cure him.&nbsp; He quickly demonstrated he
was not crazy by shaking the fever from him and agreeing not to go to
Patagonia.</p>
<p>Next, he demonstrated how crazy he really was, by deeding over to
his family, unsolicited, the ten acres on Tarwater Flat, the house,
barn, outbuildings, and water-rights.&nbsp; Also did he turn over the
eight hundred dollars in bank that was the long-saved salvage of his
wrecked fortune.&nbsp; But for this the family found no cause for committal
to the asylum, since such committal would necessarily invalidate what
he had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather is sure peeved,&rdquo; said Mary, his oldest daughter,
herself a grandmother, when her father quit smoking.</p>
<p>All he had retained for himself was a span of old horses, a mountain
buckboard, and his one room in the crowded house.&nbsp; Further, having
affirmed that he would be beholden to none of them, he got the contract
to carry the United States mail, twice a week, from Kelterville up over
Tarwater Mountain to Old Almaden - which was a sporadically worked quick-silver
mine in the upland cattle country.&nbsp; With his old horses it took
all his time to make the two weekly round trips.&nbsp; And for ten years,
rain or shine, he had never missed a trip.&nbsp; Nor had he failed once
to pay his week&rsquo;s board into Mary&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; This board
he had insisted on, in the convalescence from his Patagonian fever,
and he had paid it strictly, though he had given up tobacco in order
to be able to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he confided to the ruined water wheel of the old
Tarwater Mill, which he had built from the standing timber and which
had ground wheat for the first settlers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Huh!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
never put me in the poor farm so long as I support myself.&nbsp; And
without a penny to my name it ain&rsquo;t likely any lawyer fellows&rsquo;ll
come snoopin&rsquo; around after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, precisely because of these highly rational acts, it was
held that John Tarwater was mildly crazy!</p>
<p>The first time he had lifted the chant of &ldquo;Like Argus of the
Ancient Times,&rdquo; had been in 1849, when, twenty-two years&rsquo;
of age, violently attacked by the Californian fever, he had sold two
hundred and forty Michigan acres, forty of it cleared, for the price
of four yoke of oxen, and a wagon, and had started across the Plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we turned off at Fort Hall, where the Oregon emigration
went north&rsquo;ard, and swung south for Californy,&rdquo; was his
way of concluding the narrative of that arduous journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
Bill Ping and me used to rope grizzlies out of the underbrush of Cache
Slough in the Sacramento Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years of freighting and mining had followed, and, with a stake gleaned
from the Merced placers, he satisfied the land-hunger of his race and
time by settling in Sonoma County.</p>
<p>During the ten years of carrying the mail across Tarwater Township,
up Tarwater Valley, and over Tarwater Mountain, most all of which land
had once been his, he had spent his time dreaming of winning back that
land before he died.&nbsp; And now, his huge gaunt form more erect than
it had been for years, with a glinting of blue fires in his small and
close-set eyes, he was lifting his ancient chant again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes now - listen to him,&rdquo; said William Tarwater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody at home,&rdquo; laughed Harris Topping, day labourer,
husband of Annie Tarwater, and father of her nine children.</p>
<p>The kitchen door opened to admit the old man, returning from feeding
his horses.&nbsp; The song had ceased from his lips; but Mary was irritable
from a burnt hand and a grandchild whose stomach refused to digest properly
diluted cows&rsquo; milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there ain&rsquo;t no use you carryin&rsquo; on that way,
father,&rdquo; she tackled him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The time&rsquo;s past for
you to cut and run for a place like the Klondike, and singing won&rsquo;t
buy you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; he answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
bet I could go to that Klondike place and pick up enough gold to buy
back the Tarwater lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool!&rdquo; Annie contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t buy them back for less&rsquo;n three hundred
thousand and then some,&rdquo; was William&rsquo;s effort at squelching
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I could pick up three hundred thousand, and then some,
if I was only there,&rdquo; the old man retorted placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God you can&rsquo;t walk there, or you&rsquo;d be startin&rsquo;,
I know,&rdquo; Mary cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ocean travel costs money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to have money,&rdquo; her father said humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ain&rsquo;t got any now - so forget it,&rdquo; William
advised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them times is past, like roping bear with Bill
Ping.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t no more bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same - &rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary cut him off.&nbsp; Seizing the day&rsquo;s paper from the
kitchen table, she flourished it savagely under her aged progenitor&rsquo;s
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do those Klondikers say?&nbsp; There it is in cold print.&nbsp;
Only the young and robust can stand the Klondike.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse
than the north pole.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve left their dead a-plenty
there themselves.&nbsp; Look at their pictures.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re forty
years older &rsquo;n the oldest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Tarwater did look, but his eyes strayed to other photographs
on the highly sensational front page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at the photys of them nuggets they brought down,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know gold.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I gopher twenty
thousand outa the Merced?&nbsp; And wouldn&rsquo;t it a-ben a hundred
thousand if that cloudburst hadn&rsquo;t busted my wing-dam?&nbsp; Now
if I was only in the Klondike - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy as a loon,&rdquo; William sneered in open aside to the
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice way to talk to your father,&rdquo; Old Man Tarwater
censured mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father&rsquo;d have walloped the tar
out of me with a single-tree if I&rsquo;d spoke to him that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>are</i> crazy, father - &rdquo; William began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re right, son.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s where
my father wasn&rsquo;t crazy.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d a-done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s been reading some of them magazine articles
about men who succeeded after forty,&rdquo; Annie jibed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, daughter?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why
can&rsquo;t a man succeed after he&rsquo;s seventy?&nbsp; I was only
seventy this year.&nbsp; And mebbe I could succeed if only I could get
to the Klondike - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you ain&rsquo;t going to get to,&rdquo; Mary shut him
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, then,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;seein&rsquo;s I ain&rsquo;t,
I might just as well go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up, tall, gaunt, great-boned and gnarled, a splendid ruin
of a man.&nbsp; His ragged hair and whiskers were not grey but snowy
white, as were the tufts of hair that stood out on the backs of his
huge bony fingers.&nbsp; He moved toward the door, opened it, sighed,
and paused with a backward look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; he murmured plaintively, &ldquo;the
bottoms of my feet is itching something terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before the family stirred next morning, his horses fed and harnessed
by lantern light, breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight, Old Man
Tarwater was off and away down Tarwater Valley on the road to Kelterville.&nbsp;
Two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand
and forty times since taking the mail contract.&nbsp; He did not drive
to Kelterville, but turned off on the main road south to Santa Rosa.&nbsp;
Even more remarkable than this was the paper-wrapped parcel between
his feet.&nbsp; It contained his one decent black suit, which Mary had
been long reluctant to see him wear any more, not because it was shabby,
but because, as he guessed what was at the back of her mind, it was
decent enough to bury him in.</p>
<p>And at Santa Rosa, in a second-hand clothes shop, he sold the suit
outright for two dollars and a half.&nbsp; From the same obliging shopman
he received four dollars for the wedding ring of his long-dead wife.&nbsp;
The span of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventy-five dollars,
although twenty-five was all he received down in cash.&nbsp; Chancing
to meet Alton Granger on the street, to whom never before had he mentioned
the ten dollars loaned him in &rsquo;74, he reminded Alton Granger of
the little affair, and was promptly paid.&nbsp; Also, of all unbelievable
men to be in funds, he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought
many a drink in the old and palmy days.&nbsp; And from him John Tarwater
borrowed a dollar.&nbsp; Finally, he took the afternoon train to San
Francisco.</p>
<p>A dozen days later, carrying a half-empty canvas sack of blankets
and old clothes, he landed on the beach of Dyea in the thick of the
great Klondike Rush.&nbsp; The beach was screaming bedlam.&nbsp; Ten
thousand tons of outfit lay heaped and scattered, and twice ten thousand
men struggled with it and clamoured about it.&nbsp; Freight, by Indian-back,
over Chilcoot to Lake Linderman, had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents
a pound, which latter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton.&nbsp;
And the sub-arctic winter gloomed near at hand.&nbsp; All knew it, and
all knew that of the twenty thousand of them very few would get across
the passes, leaving the rest to winter and wait for the late spring
thaw.</p>
<p>Such the beach old John Tarwater stepped upon; and straight across
the beach and up the trail toward Chilcoot he headed, cackling his ancient
chant, a very Grandfather Argus himself, with no outfit worry in the
world, for he did not possess any outfit.&nbsp; That night he slept
on the flats, five miles above Dyea, at the head of canoe navigation.&nbsp;
Here the Dyea River became a rushing mountain torrent, plunging out
of a dark canyon from the glaciers that fed it far above.</p>
<p>And here, early next morning, he beheld a little man weighing no
more than a hundred, staggering along a foot-log under all of a hundred
pounds of flour strapped on his back.&nbsp; Also, he beheld the little
man stumble off the log and fall face-downward in a quiet eddy where
the water was two feet deep and proceed quietly to drown.&nbsp; It was
no desire of his to take death so easily, but the flour on his back
weighed as much as he and would not let him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, old man,&rdquo; he said to Tarwater, when the latter
had dragged him up into the air and ashore.</p>
<p>While he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out, they had further
talk.&nbsp; Next, he fished out a ten-dollar gold-piece and offered
it to his rescuer.</p>
<p>Old Tarwater shook his head and shivered, for the ice-water had wet
him to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I reckon I wouldn&rsquo;t object to settin&rsquo; down
to a friendly meal with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t had breakfast?&rdquo; the little man, who was
past forty and who had said his name was Anson, queried with a glance
frankly curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary bite,&rdquo; John Tarwater answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your outfit?&nbsp; Ahead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expect to buy your grub on the Inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a dollar to buy it with, friend.&nbsp; Which ain&rsquo;t
so important as a warm bite of breakfast right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Anson&rsquo;s camp, a quarter of a mile on, Tarwater found a slender,
red-whiskered young man of thirty cursing over a fire of wet willow
wood.&nbsp; Introduced as Charles, he transferred his scowl and wrath
to Tarwater, who, genially oblivious, devoted himself to the fire, took
advantage of the chill morning breeze to create a draught which the
other had left stupidly blocked by stones, and soon developed less smoke
and more flame.&nbsp; The third member of the party, Bill Wilson, or
Big Bill as they called him, came in with a hundred-and-forty-pound
pack; and what Tarwater esteemed to be a very rotten breakfast was dished
out by Charles.&nbsp; The mush was half cooked and mostly burnt, the
bacon was charred carbon, and the coffee was unspeakable.</p>
<p>Immediately the meal was wolfed down the three partners took their
empty pack-straps and headed down trail to where the remainder of their
outfit lay at the last camp a mile away.&nbsp; And old Tarwater became
busy.&nbsp; He washed the dishes, foraged dry wood, mended a broken
pack-strap, put an edge on the butcher-knife and camp-axe, and repacked
the picks and shovels into a more carryable parcel.</p>
<p>What had impressed him during the brief breakfast was the sort of
awe in which Anson and Big Bill stood of Charles.&nbsp; Once, during
the morning, while Anson took a breathing spell after bringing in another
hundred-pound pack, Tarwater delicately hinted his impression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; Anson said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
divided our leadership.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got specialities.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;m a carpenter.&nbsp; When we get to Lake Linderman, and the
trees are chopped and whipsawed into planks, I&rsquo;ll boss the building
of the boat.&nbsp; Big Bill is a logger and miner.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;ll
boss getting out the logs and all mining operations.&nbsp; Most of our
outfit&rsquo;s ahead.&nbsp; We went broke paying the Indians to pack
that much of it to the top of Chilcoot.&nbsp; Our last partner is up
there with it, moving it along by himself down the other side.&nbsp;
His name&rsquo;s Liverpool, and he&rsquo;s a sailor.&nbsp; So, when
the boat&rsquo;s built, he&rsquo;s the boss of the outfit to navigate
the lakes and rapids to Klondike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Charles - this Mr. Crayton - what might his speciality
be?&rdquo; Tarwater asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the business man.&nbsp; When it comes to business
and organization he&rsquo;s boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; Tarwater pondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very lucky to
get such a bunch of specialities into one outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than luck,&rdquo; Anson agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was all
accident, too.&nbsp; Each of us started alone.&nbsp; We met on the steamer
coming up from San Francisco, and formed the party. - Well, I got to
be goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Charles is liable to get kicking because I ain&rsquo;t
packin&rsquo; my share&rsquo; just the same, you can&rsquo;t expect
a hundred-pound man to pack as much as a hundred-and-sixty-pounder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick around and cook us something for dinner,&rdquo; Charles,
on his next load in and noting the effects of the old man&rsquo;s handiness,
told Tarwater.</p>
<p>And Tarwater cooked a dinner that was a dinner, washed the dishes,
had real pork and beans for supper, and bread baked in a frying-pan
that was so delectable than the three partners nearly foundered themselves
on it.&nbsp; Supper dishes washed, he cut shavings and kindling for
a quick and certain breakfast fire, showed Anson a trick with foot-gear
that was invaluable to any hiker, sang his &ldquo;Like Argus of the
Ancient Times,&rdquo; and told them of the great emigration across the
Plains in Forty-nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, the first cheerful and hearty-like camp since
we hit the beach,&rdquo; Big Bill remarked as he knocked out his pipe
and began pulling off his shoes for bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of made things easy, boys, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tarwater
queried genially.</p>
<p>All nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, I got a proposition, boys.&nbsp;
You can take it or leave it, but just listen kindly to it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
in a hurry to get in before the freeze-up.&nbsp; Half the time is wasted
over the cooking by one of you that he might be puttin&rsquo; in packin&rsquo;
outfit.&nbsp; If I do the cookin&rsquo; for you, you all&rsquo;ll get
on that much faster.&nbsp; Also, the cookin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll be better,
and that&rsquo;ll make you pack better.&nbsp; And I can pack quite a
bit myself in between times, quite a bit, yes, sir, quite a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Bill and Anson were just beginning to nod their heads in agreement,
when Charles stopped them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect of us in return?&rdquo; he demanded of
the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I leave it up to the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t business,&rdquo; Charles reprimanded sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You made the proposition.&nbsp; Now finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect us to feed you all winter, eh?&rdquo; Charles interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, siree, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All I reckon is a passage
to Klondike in your boat would be mighty square of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t an ounce of grub, old man.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
starve to death when you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feedin&rsquo; some long time pretty successful,&rdquo;
Old Tarwater replied, a whimsical light in his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
seventy, and ain&rsquo;t starved to death never yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sign a paper to the effect that you shift for yourself
as soon as you get to Dawson?&rdquo; the business one demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; was the response.</p>
<p>Again Charles checked his two partners&rsquo; expressions of satisfaction
with the arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One other thing, old man.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re a party of four,
and we all have a vote on questions like this.&nbsp; Young Liverpool
is ahead with the main outfit.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got a say so, and he
isn&rsquo;t here to say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a party might he be?&rdquo; Tarwater inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rough-neck sailor, and he&rsquo;s got a quick,
bad temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some turbulent,&rdquo; Anson contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the way he can cuss is simply God-awful,&rdquo; Big Bill
testified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s square,&rdquo; Big Bill added.</p>
<p>Anson nodded heartily to this appraisal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; Tarwater summed up, &ldquo;I set out for
Californy and I got there.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m going to get to Klondike.&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t a thing can stop me, ain&rsquo;t a thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to get three hundred thousand outa the ground, too.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t
a thing can stop me, ain&rsquo;t a thing, because I just naturally need
the money.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind a bad temper so long&rsquo;s the
boy is square.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take my chance, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
work along with you till we catch up with him.&nbsp; Then, if he says
no to the proposition, I reckon I&rsquo;ll lose.&nbsp; But somehow I
just can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; no, because that&rsquo;d
mean too close up to freeze-up and too late for me to find another chance
like this.&nbsp; And, as I&rsquo;m sure going to get to Klondike, it&rsquo;s
just plumb impossible for him to say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old John Tarwater became a striking figure on a trail unusually replete
with striking figures.&nbsp; With thousands of men, each back-tripping
half a ton of outfit, retracing every mile of the trail twenty times,
all came to know him and to hail him as &ldquo;Father Christmas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, as he worked, ever he raised his chant with his age-falsetto voice.&nbsp;
None of the three men he had joined could complain about his work.&nbsp;
True, his joints were stiff - he admitted to a trifle of rheumatism.&nbsp;
He moved slowly, and seemed to creak and crackle when he moved; but
he kept on moving.&nbsp; Last into the blankets at night, he was first
out in the morning, so that the other three had hot coffee before their
one before-breakfast pack.&nbsp; And, between breakfast and dinner and
between dinner and supper, he always managed to back-trip for several
packs himself.&nbsp; Sixty pounds was the limit of his burden, however.&nbsp;
He could manage seventy-five, but he could not keep it up.&nbsp; Once,
he tried ninety, but collapsed on the trail and was seriously shaky
for a couple of days afterward.</p>
<p>Work!&nbsp; On a trail where hard-working men learned for the first
time what work was, no man worked harder in proportion to his strength
than Old Tarwater.&nbsp; Driven desperately on by the near-thrust of
winter, and lured madly on by the dream of gold, they worked to their
last ounce of strength and fell by the way.&nbsp; Others, when failure
made certain, blew out their brains.&nbsp; Some went mad, and still
others, under the irk of the man-destroying strain, broke partnerships
and dissolved life-time friendships with fellows just as good as themselves
and just as strained and mad.</p>
<p>Work!&nbsp; Old Tarwater could shame them all, despite his creaking
and crackling and the nasty hacking cough he had developed.&nbsp; Early
and late, on trail or in camp beside the trail he was ever in evidence,
ever busy at something, ever responsive to the hail of &ldquo;Father
Christmas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Weary back-trippers would rest their packs on
a log or rock alongside of where he rested his, and would say: &ldquo;Sing
us that song of yourn, dad, about Forty-Nine.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, when
he had wheezingly complied, they would arise under their loads, remark
that it was real heartening, and hit the forward trail again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever a man worked his passage and earned it,&rdquo; Big
Bill confided to his two partners, &ldquo;that man&rsquo;s our old Skeezicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; Anson confirmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
valuable addition to the party, and I, for one, ain&rsquo;t at all disagreeable
to the notion of making him a regular partner - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; Charles Crayton cut in.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
we get to Dawson we&rsquo;re quit of him - that&rsquo;s the agreement.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;d only have to bury him if we let him stay on with us.&nbsp;
Besides, there&rsquo;s going to be a famine, and every ounce of grub&rsquo;ll
count.&nbsp; Remember, we&rsquo;re feeding him out of our own supply
all the way in.&nbsp; And if we run short in the pinch next year, you&rsquo;ll
know the reason.&nbsp; Steamboats can&rsquo;t get up grub to Dawson
till the middle of June, and that&rsquo;s nine months away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you put as much money and outfit in as the rest of us,&rdquo;
Big Bill conceded, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve a say according.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to have my say,&rdquo; Charles asserted
with increasing irritability.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s lucky for
you with your fool sentiments that you&rsquo;ve got somebody to think
ahead for you, else you&rsquo;d all starve to death.&nbsp; I tell you
that famine&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been studying the situation.&nbsp;
Flour will be two dollars a pound, or ten, and no sellers.&nbsp; You
mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the rubble-covered flats, up the dark canyon to Sheep Camp,
past the over-hanging and ever-threatening glaciers to the Scales, and
from the Scales up the steep pitches of ice-scoured rock where packers
climbed with hands and feet, Old Tarwater camp-cooked and packed and
sang.&nbsp; He blew across Chilcoot Pass, above timberline, in the first
swirl of autumn snow.&nbsp; Those below, without firewood, on the bitter
rim of Crater Lake, heard from the driving obscurity above them a weird
voice chanting:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Argus of the ancient times,<br />We leave this modern
Greece,<br />Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,<br />To shear the
Golden Fleece.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And out of the snow flurries they saw appear a tall, gaunt form,
with whiskers of flying white that blended with the storm, bending under
a sixty-pound pack of camp dunnage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Christmas!&rdquo; was the hail.&nbsp; And then: &ldquo;Three
rousing cheers for Father Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two miles beyond Crater Lake lay Happy Camp - so named because here
was found the uppermost fringe of the timber line, where men might warm
themselves by fire again.&nbsp; Scarcely could it be called timber,
for it was a dwarf rock-spruce that never raised its loftiest branches
higher than a foot above the moss, and that twisted and grovelled like
a pig-vegetable under the moss.&nbsp; Here, on the trail leading into
Happy Camp, in the first sunshine of half a dozen days, Old Tarwater
rested his pack against a huge boulder and caught his breath.&nbsp;
Around this boulder the trail passed, laden men toiling slowly forward
and men with empty pack-straps limping rapidly back for fresh loads.&nbsp;
Twice Old Tarwater essayed to rise and go on, and each time, warned
by his shakiness, sank back to recover more strength.&nbsp; From around
the boulder he heard voices in greeting, recognized Charles Crayton&rsquo;s
voice, and realized that at last they had met up with Young Liverpool.&nbsp;
Quickly, Charles plunged into business, and Tarwater heard with great
distinctness every word of Charles&rsquo; unflattering description of
him and the proposition to give him passage to Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dam fool proposition,&rdquo; was Liverpool&rsquo;s judgment,
when Charles had concluded.&nbsp; &ldquo;An old granddad of seventy!&nbsp;
If he&rsquo;s on his last legs, why in hell did you hook up with him?&nbsp;
If there&rsquo;s going to be a famine, and it looks like it, we need
every ounce of grub for ourselves.&nbsp; We only out-fitted for four,
not five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Tarwater heard Charles assuring
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited.&nbsp; The old codger
agreed to leave the final decision to you when we caught up with you.&nbsp;
All you&rsquo;ve got to do is put your foot down and say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s up to me to turn the old one down, after
your encouraging him and taking advantage of his work clear from Dyea
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard trail, Liverpool, and only the men that
are hard will get through,&rdquo; Charles strove to palliate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m to do the dirty work?&rdquo; Liverpool complained,
while Tarwater&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about the size of it,&rdquo; Charles said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the deciding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then old Tarwater&rsquo;s heart uprose again as the air was rent
by a cyclone of profanity, from the midst of which crackled sentences
like: - &ldquo;Dirty skunks! . . . See you in hell first! . . . My mind&rsquo;s
made up! . . . Hell&rsquo;s fire and corruption! . . . The old codger
goes down the Yukon with us, stack on that, my hearty! . . . Hard?&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know what hard is unless I show you! . . . I&rsquo;ll
bust the whole outfit to hell and gone if any of you try to side-track
him! . . . Just try to side-track him, that is all, and you&rsquo;ll
think the Day of Judgment and all God&rsquo;s blastingness has hit the
camp in one chunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the invigoratingness of Liverpool&rsquo;s flow of speech
that, quite without consciousness of effort, the old man arose easily
under his load and strode on toward Happy Camp.</p>
<p>From Happy Camp to Long Lake, from Long Lake to Deep Lake, and from
Deep Lake up over the enormous hog-back and down to Linderman, the man-killing
race against winter kept on.&nbsp; Men broke their hearts and backs
and wept beside the trail in sheer exhaustion.&nbsp; But winter never
faltered.&nbsp; The fall gales blew, and amid bitter soaking rains and
ever-increasing snow flurries, Tarwater and the party to which he was
attached piled the last of their outfit on the beach.</p>
<p>There was no rest.&nbsp; Across the lake, a mile above a roaring
torrent, they located a patch of spruce and built their saw-pit.&nbsp;
Here, by hand, with an inadequate whipsaw, they sawed the spruce-trunks
into lumber.&nbsp; They worked night and day.&nbsp; Thrice, on the night-shift,
underneath in the saw-pit, Old Tarwater fainted.&nbsp; By day he cooked
as well, and, in the betweenwhiles, helped Anson in the building of
the boat beside the torrent as the green planks came down.</p>
<p>The days grew shorter.&nbsp; The wind shifted into the north and
blew unending gales.&nbsp; In the mornings the weary men crawled from
their blankets and in their socks thawed out their frozen shoes by the
fire Tarwater always had burning for them.&nbsp; Ever arose the increasing
tale of famine on the Inside.&nbsp; The last grub steamboats up from
Bering Sea were stalled by low water at the beginning of the Yukon Flats
hundreds of miles north of Dawson.&nbsp; In fact, they lay at the old
Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s post at Fort Yukon inside the Arctic Circle.&nbsp;
Flour in Dawson was up to two dollars a pound, but no one would sell.&nbsp;
Bonanza and Eldorado Kings, with money to burn, were leaving for the
Outside because they could buy no grub.&nbsp; Miners&rsquo; Committees
were confiscating all grub and putting the population on strict rations.&nbsp;
A man who held out an ounce of grub was shot like a dog.&nbsp; A score
had been so executed already.</p>
<p>And, under a strain which had broken so many younger men, Old Tarwater
began to break.&nbsp; His cough had become terrible, and had not his
exhausted comrades slept like the dead, he would have kept them awake
nights.&nbsp; Also, he began to take chills, so that he dressed up to
go to bed.&nbsp; When he had finished so dressing, not a rag of garment
remained in his clothes bag.&nbsp; All he possessed was on his back
and swathed around his gaunt old form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Big Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he puts all he&rsquo;s
got on now, when it ain&rsquo;t lower than twenty above, what&rsquo;ll
he do later on when it goes down to fifty and sixty below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lined the rough-made boat down the mountain torrent, nearly
losing it a dozen times, and rowed across the south end of Lake Linderman
in the thick of a fall blizzard.&nbsp; Next morning they planned to
load and start, squarely into the teeth of the north, on their perilous
traverse of half a thousand miles of lakes and rapids and box canyons.&nbsp;
But before he went to bed that night, Young Liverpool was out over the
camp.&nbsp; He returned to find his whole party asleep.&nbsp; Rousing
Tarwater, he talked with him in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, dad,&rdquo; he said. - &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a passage
in our boat, and if ever a man earned a passage you have.&nbsp; But
you know yourself you&rsquo;re pretty well along in years, and your
health right now ain&rsquo;t exciting.&nbsp; If you go on with us you&rsquo;ll
croak surer&rsquo;n hell. - Now wait till I finish, dad.&nbsp; The price
for a passage has jumped to five hundred dollars.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
throwing my feet and I&rsquo;ve hustled a passenger.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
an official of the Alaska Commercial and just has to get in.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
bid up to six hundred to go with me in our boat.&nbsp; Now the passage
is yours.&nbsp; You sell it to him, poke the six hundred into your jeans,
and pull South for California while the goin&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; You
can be in Dyea in two days, and in California in a week more.&nbsp;
What d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarwater coughed and shivered for a space, ere he could get freedom
of breath for speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I just want to tell you one thing.&nbsp;
I drove my four yoke of oxen across the Plains in Forty-nine and lost
nary a one.&nbsp; I drove them plumb to Californy, and I freighted with
them afterward out of Sutter&rsquo;s Fort to American Bar.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;m going to Klondike.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t nothing can stop me,
ain&rsquo;t nothing at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to ride that boat,
with you at the steering sweep, clean to Klondike, and I&rsquo;m going
to shake three hundred thousand out of the moss-roots.&nbsp; That being
so, it&rsquo;s contrary to reason and common sense for me to sell out
my passage.&nbsp; But I thank you kindly, son, I thank you kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young sailor shot out his hand impulsively and gripped the old
man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, dad!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure
going to go then.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the real stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
looked with undisguised contempt across the sleepers to where Charles
Crayton snored in his red beard.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem
to make your kind any more, dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the north they fought their way, although old-timers, coming
out, shook their heads and prophesied they would be frozen in on the
lakes.&nbsp; That the freeze-up might come any day was patent, and delays
of safety were no longer considered.&nbsp; For this reason, Liverpool
decided to shoot the rapid stream connecting Linderman to Lake Bennett
with the fully loaded boat.&nbsp; It was the custom to line the empty
boats down and to portage the cargoes across.&nbsp; Even then many empty
boats had been wrecked.&nbsp; But the time was past for such precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb out, dad,&rdquo; Liverpool commanded as he prepared
to swing from the bank and enter the rapids.</p>
<p>Old Tarwater shook his white head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sticking to the outfit,&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to get through.&nbsp; You see, son, I&rsquo;m
going to Klondike.&nbsp; If I stick by the boat, then the boat just
naturally goes to Klondike, too.&nbsp; If I get out, then most likely
you&rsquo;ll lose the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use in overloading,&rdquo; Charles
announced, springing abruptly out on the bank as the boat cast off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you wait for my orders!&rdquo; Liverpool shouted
ashore as the current gripped the boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there won&rsquo;t
be any more walking around rapids and losing time waiting to pick you
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What took them ten minutes by river, took Charles half an hour by
land, and while they waited for him at the head of Lake Bennett they
passed the time of day with several dilapidated old-timers on their
way out.&nbsp; The famine news was graver than ever.&nbsp; The North-west
Mounted Police, stationed at the foot of Lake Marsh where the gold-rushers
entered Canadian territory, were refusing to let a man past who did
not carry with him seven hundred pounds of grub.&nbsp; In Dawson City
a thousand men, with dog-teams, were waiting the freeze-up to come out
over the ice.&nbsp; The trading companies could not fill their grub-contracts,
and partners were cutting the cards to see which should go and which
should stay and work the claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; Charles announced, when he learned
of the action of the mounted police on the boundary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old
Man, you might as well start back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb aboard!&rdquo;&nbsp; Liverpool commanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to Klondike, and old dad is going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shift of gale to the south gave them a fair wind down Lake Bennett,
before which they ran under a huge sail made by Liverpool.&nbsp; The
heavy weight of outfit gave such ballast that he cracked on as a daring
sailor should when moments counted.&nbsp; A shift of four points into
the south-west, coming just at the right time as they entered upon Caribou
Crossing, drove them down that connecting link to lakes Tagish and Marsh.&nbsp;
In stormy sunset and twilight - they made the dangerous crossing of
Great Windy Arm, wherein they beheld two other boat-loads of gold-rushers
capsize and drown.</p>
<p>Charles was for beaching for the night, but Liverpool held on, steering
down Tagish by the sound of the surf on the shoals and by the occasional
shore-fires that advertised wrecked or timid argonauts.&nbsp; At four
in the morning, he aroused Charles.&nbsp; Old Tarwater, shiveringly
awake, heard Liverpool order Crayton aft beside him at the steering-sweep,
and also heard the one-sided conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just listen, friend Charles, and keep your own mouth shut,&rdquo;
Liverpool began.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to get one thing into your
head and keep it there: <i>old dad&rsquo;s going</i> <i>by the police.&nbsp;
Understand? He&rsquo;s going</i> <i>by</i>.&nbsp; When they examine
our outfit, old dad&rsquo;s got a fifth share in it, savvee?&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll
put us all &rsquo;way under what we ought to have, but we can bluff
it through.&nbsp; Now get this, and get it hard: <i>there</i> <i>ain&rsquo;t
going to be any fall-down on this</i> <i>bluff</i> - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;d give away on the old codger - &rdquo;
Charles began indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought that,&rdquo; Liverpool checked him, &ldquo;because
I never mentioned any such thing.&nbsp; Now - get me and get me hard:
I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve been thinking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;re going to think.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make the police
post some time this afternoon, and we&rsquo;ve got to get ready to pull
the bluff without a hitch, and a word to the wise is plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ve got it in my mind - &rdquo; Charles
began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Liverpool shut him off.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s in your mind.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to know.&nbsp;
I want you to know what&rsquo;s in my mind.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s any
slip-up, if old dad gets turned back by the police, I&rsquo;m going
to pick out the first quiet bit of landscape and take you ashore on
it.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;m going to beat you up to the Queen&rsquo;s
taste.&nbsp; Get me, and get me hard.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t going to
be any half-way beating, but a real, two-legged, two-fisted, he-man
beating.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll kill you, but I&rsquo;ll
come damn near to half-killing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can I do?&rdquo; Charles almost whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one thing,&rdquo; was Liverpool&rsquo;s final word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You just pray.&nbsp; You pray so hard that old dad gets by the
police that he does get by.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Go back to
your blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they gained Lake Le Barge, the land was sheeted with snow
that would not melt for half a year.&nbsp; Nor could they lay their
boat at will against the bank, for the rim-ice was already forming.&nbsp;
Inside the mouth of the river, just ere it entered Lake Le Barge, they
found a hundred storm-bound boats of the argonauts.&nbsp; Out of the
north, across the full sweep of the great lake, blew an unending snow
gale.&nbsp; Three mornings they put out and fought it and the cresting
seas it drove that turned to ice as they fell in-board.&nbsp; While
the others broke their hearts at the oars, Old Tarwater managed to keep
up just sufficient circulation to survive by chopping ice and throwing
it overboard.</p>
<p>Each day for three days, beaten to helplessness, they turned tail
on the battle and ran back into the sheltering river.&nbsp; By the fourth
day, the hundred boats had increased to three hundred, and the two thousand
argonauts on board knew that the great gale heralded the freeze-up of
Le Barge.&nbsp; Beyond, the rapid rivers would continue to run for days,
but unless they got beyond, and immediately, they were doomed to be
frozen in for six months to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day we go through,&rdquo; Liverpool announced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We turn back for nothing.&nbsp; And those of us that dies at
the oars will live again and go on pulling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went through, winning half the length of the lake by nightfall
and pulling on through all the night hours as the wind went down, falling
asleep at the oars and being rapped awake by Liverpool, toiling on through
an age-long nightmare while the stars came out and the surface of the
lake turned to the unruffledness of a sheet of paper and froze skin-ice
that tinkled like broken glass as their oar-blades shattered it.</p>
<p>As day broke clear and cold, they entered the river, with behind
them a sea of ice.&nbsp; Liverpool examined his aged passenger and found
him helpless and almost gone.&nbsp; When he rounded the boat to against
the rim-ice to build a fire and warm up Tarwater inside and out, Charles
protested against such loss of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t business, so don&rsquo;t you come horning
in,&rdquo; Liverpool informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running the
boat trip.&nbsp; So you just climb out and chop firewood, and plenty
of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take care of dad.&nbsp; You, Anson, make a fire
on the bank.&nbsp; And you, Bill, set up the Yukon stove in the boat.&nbsp;
Old dad ain&rsquo;t as young as the rest of us, and for the rest of
this voyage he&rsquo;s going to have a fire on board to sit by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which came to pass; and the boat, in the grip of the current,
like a river steamer with smoke rising from the two joints of stove-pipe,
grounded on shoals, hung up on split currents, and charged rapids and
canyons, as it drove deeper into the Northland winter.&nbsp; The Big
and Little Salmon rivers were throwing mush-ice into the main river
as they passed, and, below the riffles, anchor-ice arose from the river
bottom and coated the surface with crystal scum.&nbsp; Night and day
the rim-ice grew, till, in quiet places, it extended out a hundred yards
from shore.&nbsp; And Old Tarwater, with all his clothes on, sat by
the stove and kept the fire going.&nbsp; Night and day, not daring to
stop for fear of the imminent freeze-up, they dared to run, an increasing
mushiness of ice running with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho, old hearty?&rdquo; Liverpool would call out at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer O,&rdquo; Old Tarwater had learned to respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I ever do for you, son, in payment?&rdquo; Tarwater,
stoking the fire, would sometimes ask Liverpool, beating now one released
hand and now the other as he fought for circulation where he steered
in the freezing stern-sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just break out that regular song of yours, old Forty-Niner,&rdquo;
was the invariable reply.</p>
<p>And Tarwater would lift his voice in the cackling chant, as he lifted
it at the end, when the boat swung in through driving cake-ice and moored
to the Dawson City bank, and all waterfront Dawson pricked its ears
to hear the triumphant paean:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Like Argus of the ancient times,<br />We leave this modern Greece,<br />Tum-tum,
tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,<br />To shear the Golden Fleece,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Charles did it, but he did it so discreetly that none of his party,
least of all the sailor, ever learned of it.&nbsp; He saw two great
open barges being filled up with men, and, on inquiry, learned that
these were grubless ones being rounded up and sent down the Yukon by
the Committee of Safety.&nbsp; The barges were to be towed by the last
little steamboat in Dawson, and the hope was that Fort Yukon, where
lay the stranded steamboats, would be gained before the river froze.&nbsp;
At any rate, no matter what happened to them, Dawson would be relieved
of their grub-consuming presence.&nbsp; So to the Committee of Safety
Charles went, privily to drop a flea in its ear concerning Tarwater&rsquo;s
grubless, moneyless, and aged condition.&nbsp; Tarwater was one of the
last gathered in, and when Young Liverpool returned to the boat, from
the bank he saw the barges in a run of cake-ice, disappearing around
the bend below Moose-hide Mountain.</p>
<p>Running in cake-ice all the way, and several times escaping jams
in the Yukon Flats, the barges made their hundreds of miles of progress
farther into the north and froze up cheek by jowl with the grub-fleet.&nbsp;
Here, inside the Arctic Circle, Old Tarwater settled down to pass the
long winter.&nbsp; Several hours&rsquo; work a day, chopping firewood
for the steamboat companies, sufficed to keep him in food.&nbsp; For
the rest of the time there was nothing to do but hibernate in his log
cabin.</p>
<p>Warmth, rest, and plenty to eat, cured his hacking cough and put
him in as good physical condition as was possible for his advanced years.&nbsp;
But, even before Christmas, the lack of fresh vegetables caused scurvy
to break out, and disappointed adventurer after disappointed adventurer
took to his bunk in abject surrender to this culminating misfortune.&nbsp;
Not so Tarwater.&nbsp; Even before the first symptoms appeared on him,
he was putting into practice his one prescription, namely, exercise.&nbsp;
From the junk of the old trading post he resurrected a number of rusty
traps, and from one of the steamboat captains he borrowed a rifle.</p>
<p>Thus equipped, he ceased from wood-chopping, and began to make more
than a mere living.&nbsp; Nor was he downhearted when the scurvy broke
out on his own body.&nbsp; Ever he ran his trap-lines and sang his ancient
chant.&nbsp; Nor could the pessimist shake his surety of the three hundred
thousand of Alaskan gold he as going to shake out of the moss-roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ain&rsquo;t gold-country,&rdquo; they told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold is where you find it, son, as I should know who was mining
before you was born, &rsquo;way back in Forty-Nine,&rdquo; was his reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What was Bonanza Creek but a moose-pasture?&nbsp; No miner&rsquo;d
look at it; yet they washed five-hundred-dollar pans and took out fifty
million dollars.&nbsp; Eldorado was just as bad.&nbsp; For all you know,
right under this here cabin, or right over the next hill, is millions
just waiting for a lucky one like me to come and shake it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of January came his disaster.&nbsp; Some powerful animal
that he decided was a bob-cat, managing to get caught in one of his
smaller traps, dragged it away.&nbsp; A heavy snow-fall put a stop midway
to his pursuit, losing the trail for him and losing himself.&nbsp; There
were but several hours of daylight each day between the twenty hours
of intervening darkness, and his efforts in the grey light and continually
falling snow succeeded only in losing him more thoroughly.&nbsp; Fortunately,
when winter snow falls in the Northland the thermometer invariably rises;
so, instead of the customary forty and fifty and even sixty degrees
below zero, the temperature remained fifteen below.&nbsp; Also, he was
warmly clad and had a full matchbox.&nbsp; Further to mitigate his predicament,
on the fifth day he killed a wounded moose that weighed over half a
ton.&nbsp; Making his camp beside it on a spruce-bottom, he was prepared
to last out the winter, unless a searching party found him or his scurvy
grew worse.</p>
<p>But at the end of two weeks there had been no sign of search, while
his scurvy had undeniably grown worse.&nbsp; Against his fire, banked
from outer cold by a shelter-wall of spruce-boughs, he crouched long
hours in sleep and long hours in waking.&nbsp; But the waking hours
grew less, becoming semi-waking or half-dreaming hours as the process
of hibernation worked their way with him.&nbsp; Slowly the sparkle point
of consciousness and identity that was John Tarwater sank, deeper and
deeper, into the profounds of his being that had been compounded ere
man was man, and while he was becoming man, when he, first of all animals,
regarded himself with an introspective eye and laid the beginnings of
morality in foundations of nightmare peopled by the monsters of his
own ethic-thwarted desires.</p>
<p>Like a man in fever, waking to intervals of consciousness, so Old
Tarwater awoke, cooked his moose-meat, and fed the fire; but more and
more time he spent in his torpor, unaware of what was day-dream and
what was sleep-dream in the content of his unconsciousness.&nbsp; And
here, in the unforgetable crypts of man&rsquo;s unwritten history, unthinkable
and unrealizable, like passages of nightmare or impossible adventures
of lunacy, he encountered the monsters created of man&rsquo;s first
morality that ever since have vexed him into the spinning of fantasies
to elude them or do battle with them.</p>
<p>In short, weighted by his seventy years, in the vast and silent loneliness
of the North, Old Tarwater, as in the delirium of drug or anaesthetic,
recovered within himself, the infantile mind of the child-man of the
early world.&nbsp; It was in the dusk of Death&rsquo;s fluttery wings
that Tarwater thus crouched, and, like his remote forebear, the child-man,
went to myth-making, and sun-heroizing, himself hero-maker and the hero
in quest of the immemorable treasure difficult of attainment.</p>
<p>Either must he attain the treasure - for so ran the inexorable logic
of the shadow-land of the unconscious - or else sink into the all-devouring
sea, the blackness eater of the light that swallowed to extinction the
sun each night . . . the sun that arose ever in rebirth next morning
in the east, and that had become to man man&rsquo;s first symbol of
immortality through rebirth.&nbsp; All this, in the deeps of his unconsciousness
(the shadowy western land of descending light), was the near dusk of
Death down into which he slowly ebbed.</p>
<p>But how to escape this monster of the dark that from within him slowly
swallowed him?&nbsp; Too deep-sunk was he to dream of escape or feel
the prod of desire to escape.&nbsp; For him reality had ceased.&nbsp;
Nor from within the darkened chamber of himself could reality recrudesce.&nbsp;
His years were too heavy upon him, the debility of disease and the lethargy
and torpor of the silence and the cold were too profound.&nbsp; Only
from without could reality impact upon him and reawake within him an
awareness of reality.&nbsp; Otherwise he would ooze down through the
shadow-realm of the unconscious into the all-darkness of extinction.</p>
<p>But it came, the smash of reality from without, crashing upon his
ear drums in a loud, explosive snort.&nbsp; For twenty days, in a temperature
that had never risen above fifty below, no breath of wind had blown
movement, no slightest sound had broken the silence.&nbsp; Like the
smoker on the opium couch refocusing his eyes from the spacious walls
of dream to the narrow confines of the mean little room, so Old Tarwater
stared vague-eyed before him across his dying fire, at a huge moose
that stared at him in startlement, dragging a wounded leg, manifesting
all signs of extreme exhaustion; it, too, had been straying blindly
in the shadow-land, and had wakened to reality only just ere it stepped
into Tarwater&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>He feebly slipped the large fur mitten lined with thickness of wool
from his right hand.&nbsp; Upon trial he found the trigger finger too
numb for movement.&nbsp; Carefully, slowly, through long minutes, he
worked the bare hand inside his blankets, up under his fur <i>parka</i>,
through the chest openings of his shirts, and into the slightly warm
hollow of his left arm-pit.&nbsp; Long minutes passed ere the finger
could move, when, with equal slowness of caution, he gathered his rifle
to his shoulder and drew bead upon the great animal across the fire.</p>
<p>At the shot, of the two shadow-wanderers, the one reeled downward
to the dark and the other reeled upward to the light, swaying drunkenly
on his scurvy-ravaged legs, shivering with nervousness and cold, rubbing
swimming eyes with shaking fingers, and staring at the real world all
about him that had returned to him with such sickening suddenness.&nbsp;
He shook himself together, and realized that for long, how long he did
not know, he had bedded in the arms of Death.&nbsp; He spat, with definite
intention, heard the spittle crackle in the frost, and judged it must
be below and far below sixty below.&nbsp; In truth, that day at Fort
Yukon, the spirit thermometer registered seventy-five degrees below
zero, which, since freezing-point is thirty-two above, was equivalent
to one hundred and seven degrees of frost.</p>
<p>Slowly Tarwater&rsquo;s brain reasoned to action.&nbsp; Here, in
the vast alone, dwelt Death.&nbsp; Here had come two wounded moose.&nbsp;
With the clearing of the sky after the great cold came on, he had located
his bearings, and he knew that both wounded moose had trailed to him
from the east.&nbsp; Therefore, in the east, were men - whites or Indians
he could not tell, but at any rate men who might stand by him in his
need and help moor him to reality above the sea of dark.</p>
<p>He moved slowly, but he moved in reality, girding himself with rifle,
ammunition, matches, and a pack of twenty pounds of moose-meat.&nbsp;
Then, an Argus rejuvenated, albeit lame of both legs and tottery, he
turned his back on the perilous west and limped into the sun-arising,
re-birthing east. . . .</p>
<p>Days later - how many days later he was never to know - dreaming
dreams and seeing visions, cackling his old gold-chant of Forty-Nine,
like one drowning and swimming feebly to keep his consciousness above
the engulfing dark, he came out upon the snow-slope to a canyon and
saw below smoke rising and men who ceased from work to gaze at him.&nbsp;
He tottered down the hill to them, still singing; and when he ceased
from lack of breath they called him variously: Santa Claus, Old Christmas,
Whiskers, the Last of the Mohicans, and Father Christmas.&nbsp; And
when he stood among them he stood very still, without speech, while
great tears welled out of his eyes.&nbsp; He cried silently, a long
time, till, as if suddenly bethinking himself, he sat down in the snow
with much creaking and crackling of his joints, and from this low vantage
point toppled sidewise and fainted calmly and easily away.</p>
<p>In less than a week Old Tarwater was up and limping about the housework
of the cabin, cooking and dish-washing for the five men of the creek.&nbsp;
Genuine sourdoughs (pioneers) they were, tough and hard-bitten, who
had been buried so deeply inside the Circle that they did not know there
was a Klondike Strike.&nbsp; The news he brought them was their first
word of it.&nbsp; They lived on an almost straight-meat diet of moose,
caribou, and smoked salmon, eked out with wild berries and somewhat
succulent wild roots they had stocked up with in the summer.&nbsp; They
had forgotten the taste of coffee, made fire with a burning glass, carried
live fire-sticks with them wherever they travelled, and in their pipes
smoked dry leaves that bit the tongue and were pungent to the nostrils.</p>
<p>Three years before, they had prospected from the head-reaches of
the Koyokuk northward and clear across to the mouth of the Mackenzie
on the Arctic Ocean.&nbsp; Here, on the whaleships, they had beheld
their last white men and equipped themselves with the last white man&rsquo;s
grub, consisting principally of salt and smoking tobacco.&nbsp; Striking
south and west on the long traverse to the junction of the Yukon and
Porcupine at Fort Yukon, they had found gold on this creek and remained
over to work the ground.</p>
<p>They hailed the advent of Tarwater with joy, never tired of listening
to his tales of Forty-Nine, and rechristened him Old Hero.&nbsp; Also,
with tea made from spruce needles, with concoctions brewed from the
inner willow bark, and with sour and bitter roots and bulbs from the
ground, they dosed his scurvy out of him, so that he ceased limping
and began to lay on flesh over his bony framework.&nbsp; Further, they
saw no reason at all why he should not gather a rich treasure of gold
from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about all of three hundred thousand,&rdquo;
they told him one morning, at breakfast, ere they departed to their
work, &ldquo;but how&rsquo;d a hundred thousand do, Old Hero?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what we figure a claim is worth, the ground being badly
spotted, and we&rsquo;ve already staked your location notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; Old Tarwater answered, &ldquo;and thanking
you kindly, all I can say is that a hundred thousand will do nicely,
and very nicely, for a starter.&nbsp; Of course, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to stop till I get the full three hundred thousand.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what I come into the country for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed and applauded his ambition and reckoned they&rsquo;d
have to hunt a richer creek for him.&nbsp; And Old Hero reckoned that
as the spring came on and he grew spryer, he&rsquo;d have to get out
and do a little snooping around himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all anybody knows,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a hillside
across the creek bottom, &ldquo;the moss under the snow there may be
plumb rooted in nugget gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said no more, but as the sun rose higher and the days grew longer
and warmer, he gazed often across the creek at the definite bench-formation
half way up the hill.&nbsp; And, one day, when the thaw was in full
swing, he crossed the stream and climbed to the bench.&nbsp; Exposed
patches of ground had already thawed an inch deep.&nbsp; On one such
patch he stopped, gathered a bunch of moss in his big gnarled hands,
and ripped it out by the roots.&nbsp; The sun smouldered on dully glistening
yellow.&nbsp; He shook the handful of moss, and coarse nuggets, like
gravel, fell to the ground.&nbsp; It was the Golden Fleece ready for
the shearing.</p>
<p>Not entirely unremembered in Alaskan annals is the summer stampede
of 1898 from Fort Yukon to the bench diggings of Tarwater Hill.&nbsp;
And when Tarwater sold his holdings to the Bowdie interests for a sheer
half-million and faced for California, he rode a mule over a new-cut
trail, with convenient road houses along the way, clear to the steamboat
landing at Fort Yukon.</p>
<p>At the first meal on the ocean-going steamship out of St. Michaels,
a waiter, greyish-haired, pain-ravaged of face, scurvy-twisted of body,
served him.&nbsp; Old Tarwater was compelled to look him over twice
in order to make certain he was Charles Crayton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it bad, eh, son?&rdquo; Tarwater queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck,&rdquo; the other complained, after recognition
and greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only one of the party that the scurvy attacked.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been through hell.&nbsp; The other three are all at work
and healthy, getting grub-stake to prospect up White River this winter.&nbsp;
Anson&rsquo;s earning twenty-five a day at carpentering, Liverpool getting
twenty logging for the saw-mill, and Big Bill&rsquo;s getting forty
a day as chief sawyer.&nbsp; I tried my best, and if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for scurvy . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, son, you done your best, which ain&rsquo;t much, you
being naturally irritable and hard from too much business.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t fit to work crippled
up this way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay your passage with the captain in kind
remembrance of the voyage you gave me, and you can lay up and take it
easy the rest of the trip.&nbsp; And what are your circumstances when
you land at San Francisco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Crayton shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; Tarwater continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
work on the ranch for you till you can start business again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could manage your business for you - &rdquo; Charles began
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, siree,&rdquo; Tarwater declared emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s always post-holes to dig, and cordwood to chop, and the
climate&rsquo;s fine . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarwater arrived home a true prodigal grandfather for whom the fatted
calf was killed and ready.&nbsp; But first, ere he sat down at table,
he must stroll out and around.&nbsp; And sons and daughters of his flesh
and of the law needs must go with him fulsomely eating out of the gnarled
old hand that had half a million to disburse.&nbsp; He led the way,
and no opinion he slyly uttered was preposterous or impossible enough
to draw dissent from his following.&nbsp; Pausing by the ruined water
wheel which he had built from the standing timber, his face beamed as
he gazed across the stretches of Tarwater Valley, and on and up the
far heights to the summit of Tarwater Mountain - now all his again.</p>
<p>A thought came to him that made him avert his face and blow his nose
in order to hide the twinkle in his eyes.&nbsp; Still attended by the
entire family, he strolled on to the dilapidated barn.&nbsp; He picked
up an age-weathered single-tree from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember that little
conversation we had just before I started to Klondike?&nbsp; Sure, William,
you remember.&nbsp; You told me I was crazy.&nbsp; And I said my father&rsquo;d
have walloped the tar out of me with a single-tree if I&rsquo;d spoke
to him that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, but that was only foolin&rsquo;,&rdquo; William temporized.</p>
<p>William was a grizzled man of forty-five, and his wife and grown
sons stood in the group, curiously watching Grandfather Tarwater take
off his coat and hand it to Mary to hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William - come here,&rdquo; he commanded imperatively.</p>
<p>No matter how reluctantly, William came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a taste, William, son, of what my father give me often
enough,&rdquo; Old Tarwater crooned, as he laid on his son&rsquo;s back
and shoulders with the single-tree.&nbsp; &ldquo;Observe, I ain&rsquo;t
hitting you on the head.&nbsp; My father had a gosh-wollickin&rsquo;
temper and never drew the line at heads when he went after tar. - Don&rsquo;t
jerk your elbows back that way!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re likely to get a crack
on one by accident.&nbsp; And just tell me one thing, William, son:
is there nary notion in your head that I&rsquo;m crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; William yelped out in pain, as he danced about.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t crazy, father of course you ain&rsquo;t crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it,&rdquo; Old Tarwater remarked sententiously, tossing
the single-tree aside and starting to struggle into his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s all go in and eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glen Ellen, California,<br /><i>September</i> 14, 1916.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>STORY: THE PRINCESS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>A fire burned cheerfully in the jungle camp, and beside the fire
lolled a cheerful-seeming though horrible-appearing man.&nbsp; This
was a hobo jungle, pitched in a thin strip of woods that lay between
a railroad embankment and the bank of a river.&nbsp; But no hobo was
the man.&nbsp; So deep-sunk was he in the social abyss that a proper
hobo would not sit by the same fire with him.&nbsp; A gay-cat, who is
an ignorant new-comer on the &ldquo;Road,&rdquo; might sit with such
as he, but only long enough to learn better.&nbsp; Even low down bindle-stiffs
and stew-bums, after a once-over, would have passed this man by.&nbsp;
A genuine hobo, a couple of punks, or a bunch of tender-yeared road-kids
might have gone through his rags for any stray pennies or nickels and
kicked him out into the darkness.&nbsp; Even an alki-stiff would have
reckoned himself immeasurably superior.</p>
<p>For this man was that hybrid of tramp-land, an alki-stiff that has
degenerated into a stew-bum, with so little self-respect that he will
never &ldquo;boil-up,&rdquo; and with so little pride that he will eat
out of a garbage can.&nbsp; He was truly horrible-appearing.&nbsp; He
might have been sixty years of age; he might have been ninety.&nbsp;
His garments might have been discarded by a rag-picker.&nbsp; Beside
him, an unrolled bundle showed itself as consisting of a ragged overcoat
and containing an empty and smoke-blackened tomato can, an empty and
battered condensed milk can, some dog-meat partly wrapped in brown paper
and evidently begged from some butcher-shop, a carrot that had been
run over in the street by a wagon-wheel, three greenish-cankered and
decayed potatoes, and a sugar-bun with a mouthful bitten from it and
rescued from the gutter, as was made patent by the gutter-filth that
still encrusted it.</p>
<p>A prodigious growth of whiskers, greyish-dirty and untrimmed for
years, sprouted from his face.&nbsp; This hirsute growth should have
been white, but the season was summer and it had not been exposed to
a rain-shower for some time.&nbsp; What was visible of the face looked
as if at some period it had stopped a hand-grenade.&nbsp; The nose was
so variously malformed in its healed brokenness that there was no bridge,
while one nostril, the size of a pea, opened downward, and the other,
the size of a robin&rsquo;s egg, tilted upward to the sky.&nbsp; One
eye, of normal size, dim-brown and misty, bulged to the verge of popping
out, and as if from senility wept copiously and continuously.&nbsp;
The other eye, scarcely larger than a squirrel&rsquo;s and as uncannily
bright, twisted up obliquely into the hairy scar of a bone-crushed eyebrow.&nbsp;
And he had but one arm.</p>
<p>Yet was he cheerful.&nbsp; On his face, in mild degree, was depicted
sensuous pleasure as he lethargically scratched his ribs with his one
hand.&nbsp; He pawed over his food-scraps, debated, then drew a twelve-ounce
druggist bottle from his inside coat-pocket.&nbsp; The bottle was full
of a colourless liquid, the contemplation of which made his little eye
burn brighter and quickened his movements.&nbsp; Picking up the tomato
can, he arose, went down the short path to the river, and returned with
the can filled with not-nice river water.&nbsp; In the condensed milk
can he mixed one part of water with two parts of fluid from the bottle.&nbsp;
This colourless fluid was druggist&rsquo;s alcohol, and as such is known
in tramp-land as &ldquo;alki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slow footsteps, coming down the side of the railroad embankment,
alarmed him ere he could drink.&nbsp; Placing the can carefully upon
the ground between his legs, he covered it with his hat and waited anxiously
whatever impended.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness emerged a man as filthy ragged as he.&nbsp; The
new-comer, who might have been fifty, and might have been sixty, was
grotesquely fat.&nbsp; He bulged everywhere.&nbsp; He was composed of
bulges.&nbsp; His bulbous nose was the size and shape of a turnip.&nbsp;
His eyelids bulged and his blue eyes bulged in competition with them.&nbsp;
In many places the seams of his garments had parted across the bulges
of body.&nbsp; His calves grew into his feet, for the broken elastic
sides of his Congress gaiters were swelled full with the fat of him.&nbsp;
One arm only he sported, from the shoulder of which was suspended a
small and tattered bundle with the mud caked dry on the outer covering
from the last place he had pitched his doss.&nbsp; He advanced with
tentative caution, made sure of the harmlessness of the man beside the
fire, and joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, grandpa,&rdquo; the new-comer greeted, then paused
to stare at the other&rsquo;s flaring, sky-open nostril.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say,
Whiskers, how&rsquo;d ye keep the night dew out of that nose o&rsquo;
yourn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whiskers growled an incoherence deep in his throat and spat into
the fire in token that he was not pleased by the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike,&rdquo; the fat man chuckled, &ldquo;if
you got caught out in a rainstorm without an umbrella you&rsquo;d sure
drown, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it, Fatty, can it,&rdquo; Whiskers muttered wearily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; new in that line of chatter.&nbsp;
Even the bulls hand it out to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can still drink, I hope&rdquo;; Fatty at the same
time mollified and invited, with his one hand deftly pulling the slip-knots
that fastened his bundle.</p>
<p>From within the bundle he brought to light a twelve-ounce bottle
of alki.&nbsp; Footsteps coming down the embankment alarmed him, and
he hid the bottle under his hat on the ground between his legs.</p>
<p>But the next comer proved to be not merely one of their own ilk,
but likewise to have only one arm.&nbsp; So forbidding of aspect was
he that greetings consisted of no more than grunts.&nbsp; Huge-boned,
tall, gaunt to cadaverousness, his face a dirty death&rsquo;s head,
he was as repellent a nightmare of old age as ever Dor&eacute; imagined.&nbsp;
His toothless, thin-lipped mouth was a cruel and bitter slash under
a great curved nose that almost met the chin and that was like a buzzard&rsquo;s
beak.&nbsp; His one hand, lean and crooked, was a talon.&nbsp; The beady
grey eyes, unblinking and unwavering, were bitter as death, as bleak
as absolute zero and as merciless.&nbsp; His presence was a chill, and
Whiskers and Fatty instinctively drew together for protection against
the unguessed threat of him.&nbsp; Watching his chance, privily, Whiskers
snuggled a chunk of rock several pounds in weigh close to his hand if
need for action should arise.&nbsp; Fatty duplicated the performance.</p>
<p>Then both sat licking their lips, guiltily embarrassed, while the
unblinking eyes of the terrible one bored into them, now into one, now
into another, and then down at the rock-chunks of their preparedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; sneered the terrible one, with such dreadfulness
of menace as to cause Whiskers and Fatty involuntarily to close their
hands down on their cave-man&rsquo;s weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; the other repeated, reaching his one talon into
his side coat pocket with swift definiteness.&nbsp; &ldquo;A hell of
a chance you two cheap bums &rsquo;d have with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talon emerged, clutching ready for action a six-pound iron quoit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; for trouble, Slim,&rdquo; Fatty
quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in hell are you to call me &lsquo;Slim&rsquo;?&rdquo;
came the snarling answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just Fatty, an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s
I never seen you before - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I suppose that&rsquo;s Whiskers, there, with the
gay an&rsquo; festive lamp tan-going into his eyebrow an&rsquo; the
God-forgive-us nose joy-riding all over his mug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do, it&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Whiskers muttered uncomfortably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One monica&rsquo;s as good as another, I find, at my time of
life.&nbsp; And everybody hands it out to me anyway.&nbsp; And I need
an umbrella when it rains to keep from getting drowned, an&rsquo; all
the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t used to company - don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo;
Slim growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;So if you guys want to stick around, mind
your step, that&rsquo;s all, mind your step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fished from his pocket a cigar stump, self-evidently shot from
the gutter, and prepared to put it in his mouth to chew.&nbsp; Then
he changed his mind, glared at his companions savagely, and unrolled
his bundle.&nbsp; Appeared in his hand a druggist&rsquo;s bottle of
alki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;I suppose I gotta give you
cheap skates a drink when I ain&rsquo;t got more&rsquo;n enough for
a good petrification for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost a softening flicker of light was imminent in his withered
face as he beheld the others proudly lift their hats and exhibit their
own supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some water for the mixin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Whiskers
said, proffering his tomato-can of river slush.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stockyards
just above,&rdquo; he added apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they say
- &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Slim snapped short, mixing the drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
drunk worse&rsquo;n stockyards in my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet when all was ready, cans of alki in their solitary hands, the
three things that had once been men hesitated, as if of old habit, and
next betrayed shame as if at self-exposure.</p>
<p>Whiskers was the first to brazen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sat in at many a finer drinking,&rdquo; he bragged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the pewter,&rdquo; Slim sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the silver,&rdquo; Whiskers corrected.</p>
<p>Slim turned a scorching eye-interrogation on Fatty.</p>
<p>Fatty nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath the salt,&rdquo; said Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above it,&rdquo; came Fatty&rsquo;s correction.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was born above it, and I&rsquo;ve never travelled second class.&nbsp;
First or steerage, but no intermediate in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo; Whiskers queried of Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In broken glass to the Queen, God bless her,&rdquo; Slim answered,
solemnly, without snarl or sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pantry?&rdquo; Fatty insinuated.</p>
<p>Simultaneously Slim reached for his quoit, and Whiskers and Fatty
for their rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s get feverish,&rdquo; Fatty said,
dropping his own weapon.&nbsp; &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t scum.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
gentlemen.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s drink like gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be a real drinking,&rdquo; Whiskers approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get petrified,&rdquo; Slim agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many
a distillery&rsquo;s flowed under the bridge since we were gentlemen;
but let&rsquo;s forget the long road we&rsquo;ve travelled since, and
hit our doss in the good old fashion in which every gentleman went to
bed when we were young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father done it - did it,&rdquo; Fatty concurred and corrected,
as old recollections exploded long-sealed brain-cells of connotation
and correct usage.</p>
<p>The other two nodded a descent from similar fathers, and elevated
their tin cans of alcohol.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>By the time each had finished his own bottle and from his rags fished
forth a second one, their brains were well-mellowed and a-glow, although
they had not got around to telling their real names.&nbsp; But their
English had improved.&nbsp; They spoke it correctly, while the argo
of tramp-land ceased from their lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my constitution,&rdquo; Whiskers was explaining.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very few men could go through what I have and live to tell the
tale.&nbsp; And I never took any care of myself.&nbsp; If what the moralists
and the physiologists say were true, I&rsquo;d have been dead long ago.&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;s the same with you two.&nbsp; Look at us, at our advanced
years, carousing as the young ones don&rsquo;t dare, sleeping out in
the open on the ground, never sheltered from frost nor rain nor storm,
never afraid of pneumonia or rheumatism that would put half the young
ones on their backs in hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to mix another drink, and Fatty took up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve had our fun,&rdquo; he boasted, &ldquo;and
speaking of sweethearts and all,&rdquo; he cribbed from Kipling, &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve
rogued and we&rsquo;ve ranged - &rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In our time,&rsquo;&rdquo; Slim completed the crib
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so, I should say so,&rdquo; Fatty confirmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And been loved by princesses - at least I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and tell us about it,&rdquo; Whiskers urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
night&rsquo;s young, and why shouldn&rsquo;t we remember back to the
roofs of kings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing loth, Fatty cleared his throat for the recital and cast about
in his mind for the best way to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be known that I came of good family.&nbsp; Percival
Delaney, let us say, yes, let us say Percival Delaney, was not unknown
at Oxford once upon a time - not for scholarship, I am frank to admit;
but the gay young dogs of that day, if any be yet alive, would remember
him - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people came over with the Conqueror,&rdquo; Whiskers interrupted,
extending his hand to Fatty&rsquo;s in acknowledgment of the introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo; Fatty queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not seem
quite to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delarouse, Chauncey Delarouse.&nbsp; The name will serve as
well as any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both completed the handshake and glanced to Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, while we&rsquo;re about it . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Fatty
urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce Cadogan Cavendish,&rdquo; Slim growled morosely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go on, Percival, with your princesses and the roofs of kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was a rare young devil,&rdquo; Percival obliged, &ldquo;after
I played ducks and drakes at home and sported out over the world.&nbsp;
And I was some figure of a man before I lost my shape - polo, steeple-chasing,
boxing.&nbsp; I won medals at buckjumping in Australia, and I held more
than several swimming records from the quarter of a mile up.&nbsp; Women
turned their heads to look when I went by.&nbsp; The women!&nbsp; God
bless them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Fatty, alias Percival Delaney, a grotesque of manhood, put his
bulgy hand to his puffed lips and kissed audibly into the starry vault
of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Princess!&rdquo; he resumed, with another kiss to
the stars.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was as fine a figure of a woman as I was
a man, as high-spirited and courageous, as reckless and dare-devilish.&nbsp;
Lord, Lord, in the water she was a mermaid, a sea-goddess.&nbsp; And
when it came to blood, beside her I was parvenu.&nbsp; Her royal line
traced back into the mists of antiquity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not a daughter of a fair-skinned folk.&nbsp; Tawny
golden was she, with golden-brown eyes, and her hair that fell to her
knees was blue-black and straight, with just the curly tendrilly tendency
that gives to woman&rsquo;s hair its charm.&nbsp; Oh, there were no
kinks in it, any more than were there kinks in the hair of her entire
genealogy.&nbsp; For she was Polynesian, glowing, golden, lovely and
lovable, royal Polynesian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he paused to kiss his hand to the memory of her, and Slim,
alias Bruce Cadogan Cavendish, took advantage to interject:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&nbsp; Maybe you didn&rsquo;t shine in scholarship, but
at least you gleaned a vocabulary out of Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the South Seas garnered a better vocabulary from the
lexicon of Love,&rdquo; Percival was quick on the uptake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the island of Talofa,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;meaning
love, the Isle of Love, and it was her island.&nbsp; Her father, the
king, an old man, sat on his mats with paralysed knees and drank squareface
gin all day and most of the night, out of grief, sheer grief.&nbsp;
She, my princess, was the only issue, her brother having been lost in
their double canoe in a hurricane while coming up from a voyage to Samoa.&nbsp;
And among the Polynesians the royal women have equal right with the
men to rule.&nbsp; In fact, they trace their genealogies always by the
female line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this both Chauncey Delarouse and Bruce Cadogan Cavendish nodded
prompt affirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Percival, &ldquo;I perceive you both know
the South Seas, wherefore, without undue expenditure of verbiage on
my part, I am assured that you will appreciate the charm of my princess,
the Princess Tui-nui of Talofa, the Princess of the Isle of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed his hand to her, sipped from his condensed milk can a man-size
drink of druggist&rsquo;s alcohol, and to her again kissed her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was coy, and ever she fluttered near to me but never
near enough.&nbsp; When my arm went out to her to girdle her, presto,
she was not there.&nbsp; I knew, as never before, nor since, the thousand
dear and delightful anguishes of love frustrated but ever resilient
and beckoned on by the very goddess of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some vocabulary,&rdquo; Bruce Cadogan Cavendish muttered in
aside to Chauncey Delarouse.&nbsp; But Percival Delaney was not to be
deterred.&nbsp; He kissed his pudgy hand aloft into the night and held
warmly on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fond agonies of rapture deferred that were not lavished
upon me by my dear Princess, herself ever a luring delight of promise
flitting just beyond my reach.&nbsp; Every sweet lover&rsquo;s inferno
unguessed of by Dante she led me through.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Those swooning
tropic nights, under our palm trees, the distant surf a langourous murmur
as from some vast sea shell of mystery, when she, my Princess, all but
melted to my yearning, and with her laughter, that was as silver strings
by buds and blossoms smitten, all but made lunacy of my lover&rsquo;s
ardency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was by my wrestling with the champions of Talofa that I
first interested her.&nbsp; It was by my prowess at swimming that I
awoke her.&nbsp; And it was by a certain swimming deed that I won from
her more than coquettish smiles and shy timidities of feigned retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were squidding that day, out on the reef - you know how,
undoubtedly, diving down the face of the wall of the reef, five fathoms,
ten fathoms, any depth within reason, and shoving our squid-sticks into
the likely holes and crannies of the coral where squid might be lairing.&nbsp;
With the squid-stick, bluntly sharp at both ends, perhaps a foot long,
and held crosswise in the hand, the trick was to gouge any lazying squid
until he closed his tentacles around fist, stick and arm. - Then you
had him, and came to the surface with him, and hit him in the head which
is in the centre of him, and peeled him off into the waiting canoe.
. . . And to think I used to do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Delaney paused a moment, a glimmer of awe on his rotund
face, as he contemplated the mighty picture of his youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve pulled out a squid with tentacles eight feet
long, and done it under fifty feet of water.&nbsp; I could stay down
four minutes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone down, with a coral-rock to sink
me, in a hundred and ten feet to clear a fouled anchor.&nbsp; And I
could back-dive with a once-over and go in feet-first from eighty feet
above the surface - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit it, delete it, cease it,&rdquo; Chauncey Delarouse admonished
testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell of the Princess.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
makes old blood leap again.&nbsp; Almost can I see her.&nbsp; Was she
wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Delaney kissed unutterable affirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said she was a mermaid.&nbsp; She was.&nbsp; I know
she swam thirty-six hours before being rescued, after her schooner was
capsized in a double-squall.&nbsp; I have seen her do ninety feet and
bring up pearl shell in each hand.&nbsp; She was wonderful.&nbsp; As
a woman she was ravishing, sublime.&nbsp; I have said she was a sea-goddess.&nbsp;
She was.&nbsp; Oh, for a Phidias or a Praxiteles to have made the wonder
of her body immortal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that day, out for squid on the reef, I was almost sick
for her.&nbsp; Mad - I know I was mad for her.&nbsp; We would step over
the side from the big canoe, and swim down, side by side, into the delicious
depths of cool and colour, and she would look at me, as we swam, and
with her eyes tantalize me to further madness.&nbsp; And at last, down,
far down, I lost myself and reached for her.&nbsp; She eluded me like
the mermaid she was, and I saw the laughter on her face as she fled.&nbsp;
She fled deeper, and I knew I had her for I was between her and the
surface; but in the muck coral sand of the bottom she made a churning
with her squid stick.&nbsp; It was the old trick to escape a shark.&nbsp;
And she worked it on me, rolling the water so that I could not see her.&nbsp;
And when I came up, she was there ahead of me, clinging to the side
of the canoe and laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost I would not be denied.&nbsp; But not for nothing was
she a princess.&nbsp; She rested her hand on my arm and compelled me
to listen.&nbsp; We should play a game, she said, enter into a competition
for which should get the more squid, the biggest squid, and the smallest
squid.&nbsp; Since the wagers were kisses, you can well imagine I went
down on the first next dive with soul aflame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got no squid.&nbsp; Never again in all my life have I dived
for squid.&nbsp; Perhaps we were five fathoms down and exploring the
face of the reefwall for lurking places of our prey, when it happened.&nbsp;
I had found a likely lair and just proved it empty, when I felt or sensed
the nearness of something inimical.&nbsp; I turned.&nbsp; There it was,
alongside of me, and no mere fish-shark.&nbsp; Fully a dozen feet in
length, with the unmistakable phosphorescent cat&rsquo;s eye gleaming
like a drowning star, I knew it for what it was, a tiger shark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ten feet to the right, probing a coral fissure with her
squid stick, was the Princess, and the tiger shark was heading directly
for her.&nbsp; My totality of thought was precipitated to consciousness
in a single all-embracing flash.&nbsp; The man-eater must be deflected
from her, and what was I, except a mad lover who would gladly fight
and die, or more gladly fight and live, for his beloved?&nbsp; Remember,
she was the woman wonderful, and I was aflame for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing fully the peril of my act, I thrust the blunt-sharp
end of my squid-stick into the side of the shark, much as one would
attract a passing acquaintance with a thumb-nudge in the ribs.&nbsp;
And the man-eater turned on me.&nbsp; You know the South Seas, and you
know that the tiger shark, like the bald-face grizzly of Alaska, never
gives trail.&nbsp; The combat, fathoms deep under the sea, was on -
if by combat may be named such a one-sided struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess unaware, caught her squid and rose to the surface.&nbsp;
The man-eater rushed me.&nbsp; I fended him off with both hands on his
nose above his thousand-toothed open mouth, so that he backed me against
the sharp coral.&nbsp; The scars are there to this day.&nbsp; Whenever
I tried to rise, he rushed me, and I could not remain down there indefinitely
without air.&nbsp; Whenever he rushed me, I fended him off with my hands
on his nose.&nbsp; And I would have escaped unharmed, except for the
slip of my right hand.&nbsp; Into his mouth it went to the elbow.&nbsp;
His jaws closed, just below the elbow.&nbsp; You know how a shark&rsquo;s
teeth are.&nbsp; Once in they cannot be released.&nbsp; They must go
through to complete the bite, but they cannot go through heavy bone.&nbsp;
So, from just below the elbow he stripped the bone clean to the articulation
of the wrist-joint, where his teeth met and my good right hand became
his for an appetizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while he was doing this, I drove the thumb of my left
hand, to the hilt into his eye-orifice and popped out his eye.&nbsp;
This did not stop him.&nbsp; The meat had maddened him.&nbsp; He pursued
the gushing stump of my wrist.&nbsp; Half a dozen times I fended with
my intact arm.&nbsp; Then he got the poor mangled arm again, closed
down, and stripped the meat off the bone from the shoulder down to the
elbow-joint, where his teeth met and he was free of his second mouthful
of me.&nbsp; But, at the same time, with my good arm, I thumbed out
his remaining eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percival Delaney shrugged his shoulders, ere he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From above, those in the canoe had beheld the entire happening
and were loud in praise of my deed.&nbsp; To this day they still sing
the song of me, and tell the tale of me.&nbsp; And the Princess.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His pause was brief but significant.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Princess married
me. . . . Oh, well-a-day and lack-a-day, the whirligig of time and fortune,
the topsyturviness of luck, the wooden shoe going up and the polished
heel descending a French gunboat, a conquered island kingdom of Oceania,
to-day ruled over by a peasant-born, unlettered, colonial gendarme,
and . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>He completed the sentence and the tale by burying his face in the
down-tilted mouth of the condensed milk can and by gurgling the corrosive
drink down his throat in thirsty gulps.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>After an appropriate pause, Chauncey Delarouse, otherwise Whiskers,
took up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me to boast of no matter what place of birth
I have descended from to sit here by this fire with such as . . . as
chance along.&nbsp; I may say, however, that I, too, was once a considerable
figure of a man.&nbsp; I may add that it was horses, plus parents too
indulgent, that exiled me out over the world.&nbsp; I may still wonder
to query: &lsquo;Are Dover&rsquo;s cliffs still white?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Bruce Cadogan Cavendish sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Next
you&rsquo;ll be asking: &lsquo;How fares the old Lord Warden?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I took every liberty, and vainly, with a constitution
that was iron,&rdquo; Whiskers hurried on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I am with
my three score and ten behind me, and back on that long road have I
buried many a youngster that was as rare and devilish as I, but who
could not stand the pace.&nbsp; I knew the worst too young.&nbsp; And
now I know the worst too old.&nbsp; But there was a time, alas all too
short, when I knew, the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, kiss my hand to the Princess of my heart.&nbsp; She
was truly a princess, Polynesian, a thousand miles and more away to
the eastward and the south from Delaney&rsquo;s Isle of Love.&nbsp;
The natives of all around that part of the South Seas called it the
Jolly Island.&nbsp; Their own name, the name of the people who dwelt
thereon, translates delicately and justly into &lsquo;The Island of
Tranquil Laughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the chart you will find the erroneous
name given to it by the old navigators to be Manatomana.&nbsp; The seafaring
gentry the round ocean around called it the Adamless Eden.&nbsp; And
the missionaries for a time called it God&rsquo;s Witness - so great
had been their success at converting the inhabitants.&nbsp; As for me,
it was, and ever shall be, Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was <i>my</i> Paradise, for it was there my Princess lived.&nbsp;
John Asibeli Tungi was king.&nbsp; He was full-blooded native, descended
out of the oldest and highest chief-stock that traced back to Manua
which was the primeval sea home of the race.&nbsp; Also was he known
as John the Apostate.&nbsp; He lived a long life and apostasized frequently.&nbsp;
First converted by the Catholics, he threw down the idols, broke the
tabus, cleaned out the native priests, executed a few of the recalcitrant
ones, and sent all his subjects to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next he fell for the traders, who developed in him a champagne
thirst, and he shipped off the Catholic priests to New Zealand.&nbsp;
The great majority of his subjects always followed his lead, and, having
no religion at all, ensued the time of the Great Licentiousness, when
by all South Seas missionaries his island, in sermons, was spoken of
as Babylon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the traders ruined his digestion with too much champagne,
and after several years he fell for the Gospel according to the Methodists,
sent his people to church, and cleaned up the beach and the trading
crowd so spick and span that he would not permit them to smoke a pipe
out of doors on Sunday, and, fined one of the chief traders one hundred
gold sovereigns for washing his schooner&rsquo;s decks on the Sabbath
morn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the time of the Blue Laws, but perhaps it was too
rigorous for King John.&nbsp; Off he packed the Methodists, one fine
day, exiled several hundred of his people to Samoa for sticking to Methodism,
and, of all things, invented a religion of his own, with himself the
figure-head of worship.&nbsp; In this he was aided and abetted by a
renegade Fijian.&nbsp; This lasted five years.&nbsp; Maybe he grew tired
of being God, or maybe it was because the Fijian decamped with the six
thousand pounds in the royal treasury; but at any rate the Second Reformed
Wesleyans got him, and his entire kingdom went Wesleyan.&nbsp; The pioneer
Wesleyan missionary he actually made prime minister, and what he did
to the trading crowd was a caution.&nbsp; Why, in the end, King John&rsquo;s
kingdom was blacklisted and boycotted by the traders till the revenues
diminished to zero, the people went bankrupt, and King John couldn&rsquo;t
borrow a shilling from his most powerful chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time he was getting old, and philosophic, and tolerant,
and spiritually atavistic.&nbsp; He fired out the Second Reformed Wesleyans,
called back the exiles from Samoa, invited in the traders, held a general
love-feast, took the lid off, proclaimed religious liberty and high
tariff, and as for himself went back to the worship of his ancestors,
dug up the idols, reinstated a few octogenarian priests, and observed
the tabus.&nbsp; All of which was lovely for the traders, and prosperity
reigned.&nbsp; Of course, most of his subjects followed him back into
heathen worship.&nbsp; Yet quite a sprinkling of Catholics, Methodists
and Wesleyans remained true to their beliefs and managed to maintain
a few squalid, one-horse churches.&nbsp; But King John didn&rsquo;t
mind, any more than did he the high times of the traders along the beach.&nbsp;
Everything went, so long as the taxes were paid.&nbsp; Even when his
wife, Queen Mamare, elected to become a Baptist, and invited in a little,
weazened, sweet-spirited, club-footed Baptist missionary, King John
did not object.&nbsp; All he insisted on was that these wandering religions
should be self-supporting and not feed a pennyworth&rsquo;s out of the
royal coffers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the threads of my recital draw together in the paragon
of female exquisiteness - my Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whiskers paused, placed carefully on the ground his half-full condensed
milk can with which he had been absently toying, and kissed the fingers
of his one hand audibly aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the daughter of Queen Mamare.&nbsp; She was the woman
wonderful.&nbsp; Unlike the Diana type of Polynesian, she was almost
ethereal.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> ethereal, sublimated by purity, as shy
and modest as a violet, as fragile-slender as a lily, and her eyes,
luminous and shrinking tender, were as asphodels on the sward of heaven.&nbsp;
She was all flower, and fire, and dew.&nbsp; Hers was the sweetness
of the mountain rose, the gentleness of the dove.&nbsp; And she was
all of good as well as all of beauty, devout in her belief in her mother&rsquo;s
worship, which was the worship introduced by Ebenezer Naismith, the
Baptist missionary.&nbsp; But make no mistake.&nbsp; She was no mere
sweet spirit ripe for the bosom of Abraham.&nbsp; All of exquisite deliciousness
of woman was she.&nbsp; She was woman, all woman, to the last sensitive
quivering atom of her -</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I?&nbsp; I was a wastrel of the beach.&nbsp; The wildest
was not so wild as I, the keenest not so keen, of all that wild, keen
trading crowd.&nbsp; It was esteemed I played the stiffest hand of poker.&nbsp;
I was the only living man, white, brown, or black, who dared run the
Kuni-kuni Passage in the dark.&nbsp; And on a black night I have done
it under reefs in a gale of wind.&nbsp; Well, anyway, I had a bad reputation
on a beach where there were no good reputations.&nbsp; I was reckless,
dangerous, stopped at nothing in fight or frolic; and the trading captains
used to bring boiler-sheeted prodigies from the vilest holes of the
South Pacific to try and drink me under the table.&nbsp; I remember
one, a calcined Scotchman from the New Hebrides.&nbsp; It was a great
drinking.&nbsp; He died of it, and we laded him aboard ship, pickled
in a cask of trade rum, and sent him back to his own place.&nbsp; A
sample, a fair sample, of the antic tricks we cut up on the beach of
Manatomana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of all unthinkable things, what did I up and do, one day,
but look upon the Princess to find her good and to fall in love with
her.&nbsp; It was the real thing.&nbsp; I was as mad as a March hare,
and after that I got only madder.&nbsp; I reformed.&nbsp; Think of that!&nbsp;
Think of what a slip of a woman can do to a busy, roving man! - By the
Lord Harry, it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; I reformed.&nbsp; I went to church.&nbsp;
Hear me!&nbsp; I became converted.&nbsp; I cleared my soul before God
and kept my hands - I had two then - off the ribald crew of the beach
when it laughed at this, my latest antic, and wanted to know what was
my game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I reformed, and gave myself in passion and sincerity
to a religious experience that has made me tolerant of all religion
ever since.&nbsp; I discharged my best captain for immorality.&nbsp;
So did I my cook, and a better never boiled water in Manatomana.&nbsp;
For the same reason I discharged my chief clerk.&nbsp; And for the first
time in the history of trading my schooners to the westward carried
Bibles in their stock.&nbsp; I built a little anchorite bungalow up
town on a mango-lined street squarely alongside the little house occupied
by Ebenezer Naismith.&nbsp; And I made him my pal and comrade, and found
him a veritable honey pot of sweetnesses and goodnesses.&nbsp; And he
was a man, through and through a man.&nbsp; And he died long after like
a man, which I would like to tell you about, were the tale of it not
so deservedly long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Princess, more than the missionary, who was responsible
for my expressing my faith in works, and especially in that crowning
work, the New Church, Our Church, the Queen-mother&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Our poor church,&rsquo; she said to me, one night after
prayer-meeting.&nbsp; I had been converted only a fortnight.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is so small its congregation can never grow.&nbsp; And the roof leaks.&nbsp;
And King John, my hard-hearted father, will not contribute a penny.&nbsp;
Yet he has a big balance in the treasury.&nbsp; And Manatomana is not
poor.&nbsp; Much money is made and squandered, I know.&nbsp; I hear
the gossip of the wild ways of the beach.&nbsp; Less than a month ago
you lost more in one night, gambling at cards, than the cost of the
upkeep of our poor church for a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I told her it was true, but that it was before I had seen
the light.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;d had an infernal run of bad luck.)&nbsp;
I told her I had not tasted liquor since, nor turned a card.&nbsp; I
told her that the roof would be repaired at once, by Christian carpenters
selected by her from the congregation.&nbsp; But she was filled with
the thought of a great revival that Ebenezer Naismith could preach -
she was a dear saint - and she spoke of a great church, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are rich.&nbsp; You have many schooners, and traders
in far islands, and I have heard of a great contract you have signed
to recruit labour for the German plantations of Upolu.&nbsp; They say,
next to Sweitzer, you are the richest trader here.&nbsp; I should love
to see some use of all this money placed to the glory of God.&nbsp;
It would be a noble thing to do, and I should be proud to know the man
who would do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her that Ebenezer Naismith would preach the revival,
and that I would build a church great enough in which to house it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As big as the Catholic church?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the ruined cathedral, built at the time when the
entire population was converted, and it was a large order; but I was
afire with love, and I told her that the church I would build would
be even bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it will take money,&rsquo; I explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
it takes time to make money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have much,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some say
you have more money than my father, the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have more credit,&rsquo; I explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
you do not understand money.&nbsp; It takes money to have credit.&nbsp;
So, with the money I have, and the credit I have, I will work to make
more money and credit, and the church shall be built.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work!&nbsp; I was a surprise to myself.&nbsp; It is an amazement,
the amount of time a man finds on his hands after he&rsquo;s given up
carousing, and gambling, and all the time-eating diversions of the beach.&nbsp;
And I didn&rsquo;t waste a second of all my new-found time.&nbsp; Instead
I worked it overtime.&nbsp; I did the work of half a dozen men.&nbsp;
I became a driver.&nbsp; My captains made faster runs than ever and
earned bigger bonuses, as did my supercargoes, who saw to it that my
schooners did not loaf and dawdle along the way.&nbsp; And I saw to
it that my supercargoes did see to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And good!&nbsp; By the Lord Harry I was so good it hurt.&nbsp;
My conscience got so expansive and fine-strung it lamed me across the
shoulders to carry it around with me.&nbsp; Why, I even went back over
my accounts and paid Sweitzer fifty quid I&rsquo;d jiggered him out
of in a deal in Fiji three years before.&nbsp; And I compounded the
interest as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work!&nbsp; I planted sugar cane - the first commercial planting
on Manatomana.&nbsp; I ran in cargoes of kinky-heads from Malaita, which
is in the Solomons, till I had twelve hundred of the blackbirds putting
in cane.&nbsp; And I sent a schooner clear to Hawaii to bring back a
dismantled sugar mill and a German who said he knew the field-end of
cane.&nbsp; And he did, and he charged me three hundred dollars screw
a month, and I took hold of the mill-end.&nbsp; I installed the mill
myself, with the help of several mechanics I brought up from Queensland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there was a rival.&nbsp; His name was Motomoe.&nbsp;
He was the very highest chief blood next to King John&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He was full native, a strapping, handsome man, with a glowering way
of showing his dislikes.&nbsp; He certainly glowered at me when I began
hanging around the palace.&nbsp; He went back in my history and circulated
the blackest tales about me.&nbsp; The worst of it was that most of
them were true.&nbsp; He even made a voyage to Apia to find things out
- as if he couldn&rsquo;t find a plenty right there on the beach of
Manatomana!&nbsp; And he sneered at my failing for religion, and at
my going to prayer-meeting, and, most of all, at my sugar-planting.&nbsp;
He challenged me to fight, and I kept off of him.&nbsp; He threatened
me, and I learned in the nick of time of his plan to have me knocked
on the head.&nbsp; You see, he wanted the Princess just as much as I
did, and I wanted her more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to play the piano.&nbsp; So did I, once.&nbsp; But
I never let her know after I&rsquo;d heard her play the first time.&nbsp;
And she thought her playing was wonderful, the dear, fond girl!&nbsp;
You know the sort, the mechanical one-two-three tum-tum-tum school-girl
stuff.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll tell you something funnier.&nbsp; Her
playing <i>was</i> wonderful to me.&nbsp; The gates of heaven opened
to me when she played.&nbsp; I can see myself now, worn out and dog-tired
after the long day, lying on the mats of the palace veranda and gazing
upon her at the piano, myself in a perfect idiocy of bliss.&nbsp; Why,
this idea she had of her fine playing was the one flaw in her deliciousness
of perfection, and I loved her for it.&nbsp; It kind of brought her
within my human reach.&nbsp; Why, when she played her one-two-three,
tum-tum-tum, I was in the seventh heaven of bliss.&nbsp; My weariness
fell from me.&nbsp; I loved her, and my love for her was clean as flame,
clean as my love for God.&nbsp; And do you know, into my fond lover&rsquo;s
fancy continually intruded the thought that God in most ways must look
like her.</p>
<p>&ldquo; - That&rsquo;s right, Bruce Cadogan Cavendish, sneer as you
like.&nbsp; But I tell you that&rsquo;s love that I&rsquo;ve been describing.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the realest,
purest, finest thing that can happen to a man.&nbsp; And I know what
I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp; It happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whiskers, his beady squirrel&rsquo;s eye glittering from out his
ruined eyebrow like a live coal in a jungle ambush, broke off long enough
to down a sedative draught from his condensed milk can and to mix another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cane,&rdquo; he resumed, wiping his prodigious mat of
face hair with the back of his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;It matured in sixteen
months in that climate, and I was ready, just ready and no more, with
the mill for the grinding.&nbsp; Naturally, it did not all mature at
once, but I had planted in such succession that I could grind for nine
months steadily, while more was being planted and the ratoons were springing
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my troubles the first several days.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t
one thing the matter with the mill, it was another.&nbsp; On the fourth
day, Ferguson, my engineer, had to shut down several hours in order
to remedy his own troubles.&nbsp; I was bothered by the feeder.&nbsp;
After having the niggers (who had been feeding the cane) pour cream
of lime on the rollers to keep everything sweet, I sent them out to
join the cane-cutting squads.&nbsp; So I was all alone at that end,
just as Ferguson started up the mill, just as I discovered what was
the matter with the feed-rollers, and just as Motomoe strolled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood there, in Norfolk jacket, pigskin puttees, and all
the rest of the fashionable get-up out of a bandbox, sneering at me
covered with filth and grease to the eyebrows and looking like a navvy.&nbsp;
And, the rollers now white from the lime, I&rsquo;d just seen what was
wrong.&nbsp; The rollers were not in plumb.&nbsp; One side crushed the
cane well, but the other side was too open.&nbsp; I shoved my fingers
in on that side.&nbsp; The big, toothed cogs on the rollers did not
touch my fingers.&nbsp; And yet, suddenly, they did.&nbsp; With the
grip of ten thousand devils, my finger-tips were caught, drawn in, and
pulped to - well, just pulp.&nbsp; And, like a slick of cane, I had
started on my way.&nbsp; There was no stopping me.&nbsp; Ten thousand
horses could not have pulled me back.&nbsp; There was nothing to stop
me.&nbsp; Hand, arm, shoulder, head, and chest, down to the toes of
me, I was doomed to feed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did hurt.&nbsp; It hurt so much it did not hurt me at all.&nbsp;
Quite detached, almost may I say, I looked on my hand being ground up,
knuckle by knuckle, joint by joint, the back of the hand, the wrist,
the forearm, all in order slowly and inevitably feeding in.&nbsp; O
engineer hoist by thine own petard!&nbsp; O sugar-maker crushed by thine
own cane-crusher!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motomoe sprang forward involuntarily, and the sneer was chased
from his face by an expression of solicitude.&nbsp; Then the beauty
of the situation dawned on him, and he chuckled and grinned.&nbsp; No,
I didn&rsquo;t expect anything of him.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t he tried to
knock me on the head?&nbsp; What could he do anyway?&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
know anything about engines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I yelled at the top of my lungs to Ferguson to shut off the
engine, but the roar of the machinery drowned my voice.&nbsp; And there
I stood, up to the elbow and feeding right on in.&nbsp; Yes, it did
hurt.&nbsp; There were some astonishing twinges when special nerves
were shredded and dragged out by the roots.&nbsp; But I remember that
I was surprised at the time that it did not hurt worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motomoe made a movement that attracted my attention.&nbsp;
At the same time he growled out loud, as if he hated himself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
a fool.&rsquo;&nbsp; What he had done was to pick up a cane-knife -
you know the kind, as big as a machete and as heavy.&nbsp; And I was
grateful to him in advance for putting me out of my misery.&nbsp; There
wasn&rsquo;t any sense in slowly feeding in till my head was crushed,
and already my arm was pulped half way from elbow to shoulder, and the
pulping was going right on.&nbsp; So I was grateful, as I bent my head
to the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get your head out of the way, you idiot!&rsquo; he
barked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I understood and obeyed.&nbsp; I was a big man, and
he took two hacks to do it; but he hacked my arm off just outside the
shoulder and dragged me back and laid me down on the cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the sugar paid - enormously; and I built for the Princess
the church of her saintly dream, and . . . she married me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He partly assuaged his thirst, and uttered his final word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alackaday!&nbsp; Shuttlecock and battle-dore.&nbsp; And this
at, the end of it all, lined with boilerplate that even alcohol will
not corrode and that only alcohol will tickle.&nbsp; Yet have I lived,
and I kiss my hand to the dear dust of my Princess long asleep in the
great mausoleum of King John that looks across the Vale of Manona to
the alien flag that floats over the bungalow of the British Government
House. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Fatty pledged him sympathetically, and sympathetically drank out
of his own small can.&nbsp; Bruce Cadogan Cavendish glared into the
fire with implacable bitterness.&nbsp; He was a man who preferred to
drink by himself.&nbsp; Across the thin lips that composed the cruel
slash of his mouth played twitches of mockery that caught Fatty&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; And Fatty, making sure first that his rock-chunk was within
reach, challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about yourself, Bruce Cadogan Cavendish?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other lifted bleak eyes that bored into Fatty&rsquo;s until he
physically betrayed uncomfortableness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived a hard life,&rdquo; Slim grated harshly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do I know about love passages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man of your build and make-up could have escaped them,&rdquo;
Fatty wheedled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of it?&rdquo; Slim snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no reason for a gentleman to boast of amorous triumphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on, be a good fellow,&rdquo; Fatty urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
night&rsquo;s still young.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve still some drink left.&nbsp;
Delarouse and I have contributed our share.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often
that three real ones like us get together for a telling.&nbsp; Surely
you&rsquo;ve got at least one adventure in love you aren&rsquo;t ashamed
to tell about - &rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruce Cadogan Cavendish pulled forth his iron quoit and seemed to
debate whether or not he should brain the other.&nbsp; He sighed, and
put back the quoit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if you will have it,&rdquo; he surrendered with
manifest reluctance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like you two, I have had a remarkable
constitution.&nbsp; And right now, speaking of armour-plate lining,
I could drink the both of you down when you were at your prime.&nbsp;
Like you two, my beginnings were far distant and different.&nbsp; That
I am marked with the hall-mark of gentlehood there is no discussion
. . . unless either of you care to discuss the matter now . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>His one hand slipped into his pocket and clutched the quoit.&nbsp;
Neither of his auditors spoke nor betrayed any awareness of his menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It occurred a thousand miles to the westward of Manatomana,
on the island of Tagalag,&rdquo; he continued abruptly, with an air
of saturnine disappointment in that there had been no discussion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But first I must tell you of how I got to Tagalag.&nbsp; For
reasons I shall not mention, by paths of descent I shall not describe,
in the crown of my manhood and the prime of my devilishness in which
Oxford renegades and racing younger sons had nothing on me, I found
myself master and owner of a schooner so well known that she shall remain
historically nameless.&nbsp; I was running blackbird labour from the
west South Pacific and the Coral Sea to the plantations of Hawaii and
the nitrate mines of Chili - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you who cleaned out the entire population of - &rdquo;
Fatty exploded, ere he could check his speech.</p>
<p>The one hand of Bruce Cadogan Cavendish flashed pocketward and flashed
back with the quoit balanced ripe for business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; Fatty sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I . . . I have
quite forgotten what I was going to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beastly funny country over that way,&rdquo; the narrator drawled
with perfect casualness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read this Sea Wolf
stuff - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t the Sea Wolf,&rdquo; Whiskers broke in with
involuntary positiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the snarling answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Sea Wolf&rsquo;s dead, isn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m still alive,
aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; Whiskers conceded.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
suffocated head-first in the mud off a wharf in Victoria a couple of
years back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying - and I don&rsquo;t like interruptions,&rdquo;
Bruce Cadogan Cavendish proceeded, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a beastly funny
country over that way.&nbsp; I was at Taki-Tiki, a low island that politically
belongs to the Solomons, but that geologically doesn&rsquo;t at all,
for the Solomons are high islands.&nbsp; Ethnographically it belongs
to Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia, because all the breeds of the
South Pacific have gravitated to it by canoe-drift and intricately,
degeneratively, and amazingly interbred.&nbsp; The scum of the scrapings
of the bottom of the human pit, biologically speaking, resides in Taka-Tiki.&nbsp;
And I know the bottom and whereof I speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a beastly funny time of it I had, diving out shell,
fishing beche-de-mer, trading hoop-iron and hatchets for copra and ivory-nuts,
running niggers and all the rest of it.&nbsp; Why, even in Fiji the
Lotu was having a hard time of it and the chiefs still eating long-pig.&nbsp;
To the westward it was fierce - funny little black kinky-heads, man-eaters
the last Jack of them, and the jackpot fat and spilling over with wealth
- &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack-pots?&rdquo; Fatty queried.&nbsp; At sight of an irritable
movement, he added: &ldquo;You see, I never got over to the West like
Delarouse and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all head-hunters.&nbsp; Heads are valuable,
especially a white man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; They decorate the canoe-houses
and devil-devil houses with them.&nbsp; Each village runs a jack-pot,
and everybody antes.&nbsp; Whoever brings in a white man&rsquo;s head
takes the pot.&nbsp; If there aren&rsquo;t openers for a long time,
the pot grows to tremendous proportions.&nbsp; Beastly funny, isn&rsquo;t
it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t a Holland mate die on me of blackwater?&nbsp;
And didn&rsquo;t I win a pot myself?&nbsp; It was this way.&nbsp; We
were lying at Lango-lui at the time.&nbsp; I never let on, and arranged
the affair with Johnny, my boat-steerer.&nbsp; He was a kinky-head himself
from Port Moresby.&nbsp; He cut the dead mate&rsquo;s head off and sneaked
ashore in the might, while I whanged away with my rifle as if I were
trying to get him.&nbsp; He opened the pot with the mate&rsquo;s head,
and got it, too.&nbsp; Of course, next day I sent in a landing boat,
with two covering boats, and fetched him off with the loot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big was the pot?&rdquo; Whiskers asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
heard of a pot at Orla worth eighty quid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To commence with,&rdquo; Slim answered, &ldquo;there were
forty fat pigs, each worth a fathom of prime shell-money, and shell-money
worth a quid a fathom.&nbsp; That was two hundred dollars right there.&nbsp;
There were ninety-eight fathoms of shell-money, which is pretty close
to five hundred in itself.&nbsp; And there were twenty-two gold sovereigns.&nbsp;
I split it four ways: one-fourth to Johnny, one-fourth to the ship,
one-fourth to me as owner, and one-fourth to me as skipper.&nbsp; Johnny
never complained.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d never had so much wealth all at one
time in his life.&nbsp; Besides, I gave him a couple of the mate&rsquo;s
old shirts.&nbsp; And I fancy the mate&rsquo;s head is still there decorating
the canoe-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly Christian burial of a Christian,&rdquo; Whiskers
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a lucrative burial,&rdquo; Slim retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had to feed the rest of the mate over-side to the sharks for nothing.&nbsp;
Think of feeding an eight-hundred-dollar head along with it.&nbsp; It
would have been criminal waste and stark lunacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, it was all beastly funny, over there to the
westward.&nbsp; And, without telling you the scrape I got into at Taki-Tiki,
except that I sailed away with two hundred kinky-heads for Queensland
labour, and for my manner of collecting them had two British ships of
war combing the Pacific for me, I changed my course and ran to the westward
thinking to dispose of the lot to the Spanish plantations on Bangar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Typhoon season.&nbsp; We caught it.&nbsp; The <i>Merry Mist</i>
was my schooner&rsquo;s name, and I had thought she was stoutly built
until she hit that typhoon.&nbsp; I never saw such seas.&nbsp; They
pounded that stout craft to pieces, literally so.&nbsp; The sticks were
jerked out of her, deckhouses splintered to match-wood, rails ripped
off, and, after the worst had passed, the covering boards began to go.&nbsp;
We just managed to repair what was left of one boat and keep the schooner
afloat only till the sea went down barely enough to get away.&nbsp;
And we outfitted that boat in a hurry.&nbsp; The carpenter and I were
the last, and we had to jump for it as he went down.&nbsp; There were
only four of us - &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost all the niggers?&rdquo; Whiskers inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them swam for some time,&rdquo; Slim replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t fancy they made the land.&nbsp; We were ten
days&rsquo; in doing it.&nbsp; And we had a spanking breeze most of
the way.&nbsp; And what do you think we had in the boat with us?&nbsp;
Cases of square-face gin and cases of dynamite.&nbsp; Funny, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Well, it got funnier later on.&nbsp; Oh, there was a small
beaker of water, a little salt horse, and some salt-water-soaked sea
biscuit - enough to keep us alive to Tagalag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Tagalag is the disappointingest island I&rsquo;ve ever
beheld.&nbsp; It shows up out of the sea so as you can make its fall
twenty miles off.&nbsp; It is a volcano cone thrust up out of deep sea,
with a segment of the crater wall broken out.&nbsp; This gives sea entrance
to the crater itself, and makes a fine sheltered harbour.&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Nothing lives there.&nbsp; The outside and the
inside of the crater are too steep.&nbsp; At one place, inside, is a
patch of about a thousand coconut palms.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s all,
as I said, saving a few insects.&nbsp; No four-legged thing, even a
rat, inhabits the place.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s funny, most awful funny,
with all those coconuts, not even a coconut crab.&nbsp; The only meat-food
living was schools of mullet in the harbour - fattest, finest, biggest
mullet I ever laid eyes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the four of us landed on the little beach and set up housekeeping
among the coconuts with a larder full of dynamite and square-face.&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you laugh?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s funny, I tell you.&nbsp;
Try it some time. - Holland gin and straight coconut diet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
never been able to look a confectioner&rsquo;s window in the face since.&nbsp;
Now I&rsquo;m not strong on religion like Chauncey Delarouse there,
but I have some primitive ideas; and my concept of hell is an illimitable
coconut plantation, stocked with cases of square-face and populated
by ship-wrecked mariners.&nbsp; Funny?&nbsp; It must make the devil
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, straight coconut is what the agriculturists call
an unbalanced ration.&nbsp; It certainly unbalanced our digestions.&nbsp;
We got so that whenever hunger took an extra bite at us, we took another
drink of gin.&nbsp; After a couple of weeks of it, Olaf, a squarehead
sailor, got an idea.&nbsp; It came when he was full of gin, and we,
being in the same fix, just watched him shove a cap and short fuse into
a stick of dynamite and stroll down toward the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It dawned on me that he was going to shoot fish if there were
any about; but the sun was beastly hot, and I just reclined there and
hoped he&rsquo;d have luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half an hour after he disappeared we heard the explosion.&nbsp;
But he didn&rsquo;t come back.&nbsp; We waited till the cool of sunset,
and down on the beach found what had become of him.&nbsp; The boat was
there all right, grounded by the prevailing breeze, but there was no
Olaf.&nbsp; He would never have to eat coconut again.&nbsp; We went
back, shakier than ever, and cracked another square-face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day the cook announced that he would rather take
his chance with dynamite than continue trying to exist on coconut, and
that, though he didn&rsquo;t know anything about dynamite, he knew a
sight too much about coconut.&nbsp; So we bit the detonator down for
him, shoved in a fuse, and picked him a good fire-stick, while he jolted
up with a couple more stiff ones of gin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same programme as the day before.&nbsp; After a
while we heard the explosion and at twilight went down to the boat,
from which we scraped enough of the cook for a funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carpenter and I stuck it out two days more, then we drew
straws for it and it was his turn.&nbsp; We parted with harsh words;
for he wanted to take a square-face along to refresh himself by the
way, while I was set against running any chance of wasting the gin.&nbsp;
Besides, he had more than he could carry then, and he wobbled and staggered
as he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing, only there was a whole lot of him left for me
to bury, because he&rsquo;d prepared only half a stick.&nbsp; I managed
to last it out till next day, when, after duly fortifying myself, I
got sufficient courage to tackle the dynamite.&nbsp; I used only a third
of a stick - you know, short fuse, with the end split so as to hold
the head of a safety match.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where I mended my predecessors&rsquo;
methods.&nbsp; Not using the match-head, they&rsquo;d too-long fuses.&nbsp;
Therefore, when they spotted a school of mullet; and lighted the fuse,
they had to hold the dynamite till the fuse burned short before they
threw it.&nbsp; If they threw it too soon, it wouldn&rsquo;t go off
the instant it hit the water, while the splash of it would frighten
the mullet away.&nbsp; Funny stuff dynamite.&nbsp; At any rate, I still
maintain mine was the safer method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked up a school of mullet before I&rsquo;d been rowing
five minutes.&nbsp; Fine big fat ones they were, and I could smell them
over the fire.&nbsp; When I stood up, fire-stick in one hand, dynamite
stick in the other, my knees were knocking together.&nbsp; Maybe it
was the gin, or the anxiousness, or the weakness and the hunger, and
maybe it was the result of all of them, but at any rate I was all of
a shake.&nbsp; Twice I failed to touch the fire-stick to the dynamite.&nbsp;
Then I did, heard the match-head splutter, and let her go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know what happened to the others, but I
know what I did.&nbsp; I got turned about.&nbsp; Did you ever stem a
strawberry and throw the strawberry away and pop the stem into your
mouth?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I did.&nbsp; I threw the fire-stick into
the water after the mullet and held on to the dynamite.&nbsp; And my
arm went off with the stick when it went off. . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim investigated the tomato-can for water to mix himself a drink,
but found it empty.&nbsp; He stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh ho,&rdquo; he yawned, and started down the path to the
river.</p>
<p>In several minutes he was back.&nbsp; He mixed the due quantity of
river slush with the alcohol, took a long, solitary drink, and stared
with bitter moodiness into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but . . . &rdquo; Fatty suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sad Slim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then the princess married
me, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were the only person left, and there wasn&rsquo;t
any princess . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Whiskers cried out abruptly, and then
let his voice trail away to embarrassed silence.</p>
<p>Slim stared unblinkingly into the fire.</p>
<p>Percival Delaney and Chauncey Delarouse looked at each other.&nbsp;
Quietly, in solemn silence, each with his one arm aided the one arm
of the other in rolling and tying his bundle.&nbsp; And in silence,
bundles slung on shoulders, they went away out of the circle of firelight.&nbsp;
Not until they reached the top of the railroad embankment did they speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No gentleman would have done it,&rdquo; said Whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No gentleman would have done it,&rdquo; Fatty agreed.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
