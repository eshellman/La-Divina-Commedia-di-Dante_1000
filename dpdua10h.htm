<h2>ACT I</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>SCENE</p>
<p>The Market Place of Padua at noon; in the background is the great
Cathedral of Padua; the architecture is Romanesque, and wrought in black
and white marbles; a flight of marble steps leads up to the Cathedral
door; at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions; the houses
on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their windows,
and are flanked by stone arcades; on the right of the stage is the public
fountain, with a triton in green bronze blowing from a conch; around
the fountain is a stone seat; the bell of the Cathedral is ringing,
and the citizens, men, women and children, are passing into the Cathedral.</p>
<p>[Enter GUIDO FERRANTI and ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another
step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
yours!</p>
<p>[Sits down on the step of the fountain.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I think it must be here.&nbsp; [Goes up to passer-by and doffs his
cap.]&nbsp; Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church
of Santa Croce?&nbsp; [Citizen bows.]&nbsp; I thank you, sir.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ay! it is here.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it.]&nbsp; &lsquo;The
hour noon; the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint
Philip&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[reading still]&nbsp; &lsquo;I will wear a violet cloak with a silver
falcon broidered on the shoulder.&rsquo;&nbsp; A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sooner have my leathern jerkin.&nbsp; And you think he
will tell you of your father?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Why, yes!&nbsp; It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the
vineyard, just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used
to get in, a man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me
this letter, signed &lsquo;Your Father&rsquo;s Friend,&rsquo; bidding
me be here to-day if I would know the secret of my birth, and telling
me how to recognise the writer!&nbsp; I had always thought old Pedro
was my uncle, but he told me that he was not, but that I had been left
a child in his charge by some one he had never since seen.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know who your father is?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>No recollection of him even?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>None, Ascanio, none.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>[laughing]&nbsp; Then he could never have boxed your ears so often
as my father did mine.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[smiling]&nbsp; I am sure you never deserved it.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Never; and that made it worse.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the consciousness
of guilt to buoy me up.&nbsp; What hour did you say he fixed?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Noon.&nbsp; [Clock in the Cathedral strikes.]</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>It is that now, and your man has not come.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
in him, Guido.&nbsp; I think it is some wench who has set her eye at
you; and, as I have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you
shall follow me to the nearest tavern.&nbsp; [Rises.]&nbsp; By the great
gods of eating, Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as
tired as a young maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk&rsquo;s
sermon.&nbsp; Come, Guido, you stand there looking at nothing, like
the fool who tried to look into his own mind; your man will not come.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Well, I suppose you are right.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; [Just as he is leaving
the stage with ASCANIO, enter LORD MORANZONE in a violet cloak, with
a silver falcon broidered on the shoulder; he passes across to the Cathedral,
and just as he is going in GUIDO runs up and touches him.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What!&nbsp; Does my father live?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! lives in thee.<br />Thou art the same in mould and lineament,<br />Carriage
and form, and outward semblances;<br />I trust thou art in noble mind
the same.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived<br />But for this moment.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>We must be alone.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>This is my dearest friend, who out of love<br />Has followed me to
Padua; as two brothers,<br />There is no secret which we do not share.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>There is one secret which ye shall not share;<br />Bid him go hence.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[to ASCANIO]&nbsp; Come back within the hour.<br />He does not know
that nothing in this world<br />Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.<br />Within
the hour come.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Speak not to him,<br />There is a dreadful terror in his look.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[laughing]<br />Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell<br />That
I am some great Lord of Italy,<br />And we will have long days of joy
together.<br />Within the hour, dear Ascanio.<br />[Exit ASCANIO.]<br />Now
tell me of my father?<br />[Sits down on a stone seat.]<br />Stood he
tall?<br />I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.<br />His hair was
black? or perhaps a reddish gold,<br />Like a red fire of gold?&nbsp;
Was his voice low?<br />The very bravest men have voices sometimes<br />Full
of low music; or a clarion was it<br />That brake with terror all his
enemies?<br />Did he ride singly? or with many squires<br />And valiant
gentlemen to serve his state?<br />For oftentimes methinks I feel my
veins<br />Beat with the blood of kings.&nbsp; Was he a king?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[proudly]&nbsp; Then when you saw my noble father last<br />He was
set high above the heads of men?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay, he was high above the heads of men,<br />[Walks over to GUIDO
and puts his hand upon his shoulder.]<br />On a red scaffold, with a
butcher&rsquo;s block<br />Set for his neck.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[leaping up]<br />What dreadful man art thou,<br />That like a raven,
or the midnight owl,<br />Com&rsquo;st with this awful message from
the grave?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I am known here as the Count Moranzone,<br />Lord of a barren castle
on a rock,<br />With a few acres of unkindly land<br />And six not thrifty
servants.&nbsp; But I was one<br />Of Parma&rsquo;s noblest princes;
more than that,<br />I was your father&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[clasping his hand]&nbsp; Tell me of him.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,<br />He was the Prince
of Parma, and the Duke<br />Of all the fair domains of Lombardy<br />Down
to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even<br />Was wont to pay him
tribute -</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Come to his death.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>You will hear that soon enough.&nbsp; Being at war -<br />O noble
lion of war, that would not suffer<br />Injustice done in Italy! - he
led<br />The very flower of chivalry against<br />That foul adulterous
Lord of Rimini,<br />Giovanni Malatesta - whom God curse!<br />And was
by him in treacherous ambush taken,<br />And like a villain, or a low-born
knave,<br />Was by him on the public scaffold murdered.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[clutching his dagger]&nbsp; Doth Malatesta live?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>No, he is dead.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Did you say dead?&nbsp; O too swift runner, Death,<br />Couldst thou
not wait for me a little space,<br />And I had done thy bidding!</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[clutching his wrist]&nbsp; Thou canst do it!<br />The man who sold
thy father is alive.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Sold! was my father sold?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! trafficked for,<br />Like a vile chattel, for a price betrayed,<br />Bartered
and bargained for in privy market<br />By one whom he had held his perfect
friend,<br />One he had trusted, one he had well loved,<br />One whom
by ties of kindness he had bound -</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>And he lives<br />Who sold my father?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I will bring you to him.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>So, Judas, thou art living! well, I will make<br />This world thy
field of blood, so buy it straight-way,<br />For thou must hang there.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Judas said you, boy?<br />Yes, Judas in his treachery, but still<br />He
was more wise than Judas was, and held<br />Those thirty silver pieces
not enough.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What got he for my father&rsquo;s blood?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What got he?<br />Why cities, fiefs, and principalities,<br />Vineyards,
and lands.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Of which he shall but keep<br />Six feet of ground to rot in.&nbsp;
Where is he,<br />This damned villain, this foul devil? where?<br />Show
me the man, and come he cased in steel,<br />In complete panoply and
pride of war,<br />Ay, guarded by a thousand men-at-arms,<br />Yet I
shall reach him through their spears, and feel<br />The last black drop
of blood from his black heart<br />Crawl down my blade.&nbsp; Show me
the man, I say,<br />And I will kill him.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[coldly]<br />Fool, what revenge is there?<br />Death is the common
heritage of all,<br />And death comes best when it comes suddenly.<br />[Goes
up close to GUIDO.]<br />Your father was betrayed, there is your cue;<br />For
you shall sell the seller in his turn.<br />I will make you of his household,
you shall sit<br />At the same board with him, eat of his bread -</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O bitter bread!</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Thy palate is too nice,<br />Revenge will make it sweet.&nbsp; Thou
shalt o&rsquo; nights<br />Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and
be<br />His intimate, so he will fawn on thee,<br />Love thee, and trust
thee in all secret things.<br />If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh,<br />And
if it be his humour to be sad<br />Thou shalt don sables.&nbsp; Then
when the time is ripe -<br />[GUIDO clutches his sword.]<br />Nay, nay,
I trust thee not; your hot young blood,<br />Undisciplined nature, and
too violent rage<br />Will never tarry for this great revenge,<br />But
wreck itself on passion.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Thou knowest me not.<br />Tell me the man, and I in everything<br />Will
do thy bidding.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Well, when the time is ripe,<br />The victim trusting and the occasion
sure,<br />I will by sudden secret messenger<br />Send thee a sign.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>How shall I kill him, tell me?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>That night thou shalt creep into his private chamber;<br />But if
he sleep see that thou wake him first,<br />And hold thy hand upon his
throat, ay! that way,<br />Then having told him of what blood thou art,<br />Sprung
from what father, and for what revenge,<br />Bid him to pray for mercy;
when he prays,<br />Bid him to set a price upon his life,<br />And when
he strips himself of all his gold<br />Tell him thou needest not gold,
and hast not mercy,<br />And do thy business straight away.&nbsp; Swear
to me<br />Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it,<br />Or else
I go to mine own house, and leave<br />Thee ignorant, and thy father
unavenged.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Now by my father&rsquo;s sword -</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>The common hangman<br />Brake that in sunder in the public square.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Then by my father&rsquo;s grave -</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What grave? what grave?<br />Your noble father lieth in no grave,<br />I
saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes<br />Whirled through the windy
streets like common straws<br />To plague a beggar&rsquo;s eyesight,
and his head,<br />That gentle head, set on the prison spike,<br />For
the vile rabble in their insolence<br />To shoot their tongues at.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Was it so indeed?<br />Then by my father&rsquo;s spotless memory,<br />And
by the shameful manner of his death,<br />And by the base betrayal by
his friend,<br />For these at least remain, by these I swear<br />I
will not lay my hand upon his life<br />Until you bid me, then - God
help his soul,<br />For he shall die as never dog died yet.<br />And
now, the sign, what is it?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>This dagger, boy;<br />It was your father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, let me look at it!<br />I do remember now my reputed uncle,<br />That
good old husbandman I left at home,<br />Told me a cloak wrapped round
me when a babe<br />Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold;<br />I
like them best in steel, as they are here,<br />They suit my purpose
better.&nbsp; Tell me, sir,<br />Have you no message from my father
to me?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Poor boy, you never saw that noble father,<br />For when by his false
friend he had been sold,<br />Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped<br />To
bear the news to Parma to the Duchess.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Speak to me of my mother.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>When thy mother<br />Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon,<br />And,
being with untimely travail seized -<br />Bare thee into the world before
thy time,<br />And then her soul went heavenward, to wait<br />Thy father,
at the gates of Paradise.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>A mother dead, a father sold and bartered!<br />I seem to stand on
some beleaguered wall,<br />And messenger comes after messenger<br />With
a new tale of terror; give me breath,<br />Mine ears are tired.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>When thy mother died,<br />Fearing our enemies, I gave it out<br />Thou
wert dead also, and then privily<br />Conveyed thee to an ancient servitor,<br />Who
by Perugia lived; the rest thou knowest.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Saw you my father afterwards?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! once;<br />In mean attire, like a vineyard dresser,<br />I stole
to Rimini.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[taking his hand]<br />O generous heart!</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>One can buy everything in Rimini,<br />And so I bought the gaolers!
when your father<br />Heard that a man child had been born to him,<br />His
noble face lit up beneath his helm<br />Like a great fire seen far out
at sea,<br />And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido,<br />To rear
you worthy of him; so I have reared you<br />To revenge his death upon
the friend who sold him.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Thou hast done well; I for my father thank thee.<br />And now his
name?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>How you remind me of him,<br />You have each gesture that your father
had.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>The traitor&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Thou wilt hear that anon;<br />The Duke and other nobles at the Court<br />Are
coming hither.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What of that? his name?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Do they not seem a valiant company<br />Of honourable, honest gentlemen?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>His name, milord?</p>
<p>[Enter the DUKE OF PADUA with COUNT BARDI, MAFFIO, PETRUCCI, and
other gentlemen of his Court.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[quickly]<br />The man to whom I kneel<br />Is he who sold your father!
mark me well.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[clutches hit dagger]<br />The Duke!</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Leave off that fingering of thy knife.<br />Hast thou so soon forgotten?<br />[Kneels
to the DUKE.]<br />My noble Lord.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Welcome, Count Moranzone; &rsquo;tis some time<br />Since we have
seen you here in Padua.<br />We hunted near your castle yesterday -<br />Call
you it castle? that bleak house of yours<br />Wherein you sit a-mumbling
o&rsquo;er your beads,<br />Telling your vices like a good old man.<br />[Catches
sight of GUIDO and starts back.]<br />Who is that?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>My sister&rsquo;s son, your Grace,<br />Who being now of age to carry
arms,<br />Would for a season tarry at your Court</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[still looking at GUIDO]<br />What is his name?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti, sir.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>His city?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>He is Mantuan by birth.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[advancing towards GUIDO]<br />You have the eyes of one I used to
know,<br />But he died childless.&nbsp; Are you honest, boy?<br />Then
be not spendthrift of your honesty,<br />But keep it to yourself; in
Padua<br />Men think that honesty is ostentatious, so<br />It is not
of the fashion.&nbsp; Look at these lords.</p>
<p>COUNT BARDI</p>
<p>[aside]<br />Here is some bitter arrow for us, sure.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Why, every man among them has his price,<br />Although, to do them
justice, some of them<br />Are quite expensive.</p>
<p>COUNT BARDI</p>
<p>[aside]<br />There it comes indeed.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>So be not honest; eccentricity<br />Is not a thing should ever be
encouraged,<br />Although, in this dull stupid age of ours,<br />The
most eccentric thing a man can do<br />Is to have brains, then the mob
mocks at him;<br />And for the mob, despise it as I do,<br />I hold
its bubble praise and windy favours<br />In such account, that popularity<br />Is
the one insult I have never suffered.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>[aside]</p>
<p>He has enough of hate, if he needs that.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Have prudence; in your dealings with the world<br />Be not too hasty;
act on the second thought,<br />First impulses are generally good.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[aside]<br />Surely a toad sits on his lips, and spills its venom
there.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>See thou hast enemies,<br />Else will the world think very little
of thee;<br />It is its test of power; yet see thou show&rsquo;st<br />A
smiling mask of friendship to all men,<br />Until thou hast them safely
in thy grip,<br />Then thou canst crush them.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[aside]<br />O wise philosopher!<br />That for thyself dost dig so
deep a grave.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[to him]<br />Dost thou mark his words?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, be thou sure I do.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>And be not over-scrupulous; clean hands<br />With nothing in them
make a sorry show.<br />If you would have the lion&rsquo;s share of
life<br />You must wear the fox&rsquo;s skin.&nbsp; Oh, it will fit
you;<br />It is a coat which fitteth every man.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Your Grace, I shall remember.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>That is well, boy, well.<br />I would not have about me shallow fools,<br />Who
with mean scruples weigh the gold of life,<br />And faltering, paltering,
end by failure; failure,<br />The only crime which I have not committed:<br />I
would have <i>men</i> about me.&nbsp; As for conscience,<br />Conscience
is but the name which cowardice<br />Fleeing from battle scrawls upon
its shield.<br />You understand me, boy?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I do, your Grace,<br />And will in all things carry out the creed<br />Which
you have taught me.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>I never heard your Grace<br />So much in the vein for preaching;
let the Cardinal<br />Look to his laurels, sir.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>The Cardinal!<br />Men follow my creed, and they gabble his.<br />I
do not think much of the Cardinal;<br />Although he is a holy churchman,
and<br />I quite admit his dulness.&nbsp; Well, sir, from now<br />We
count you of our household<br />[He holds out his hand for GUIDO to
kiss.&nbsp; GUIDO starts back in horror, but at a gesture from COUNT
MORANZONE, kneels and kisses it.]<br />We will see<br />That you are
furnished with such equipage<br />As doth befit your honour and our
state.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I thank your Grace most heartily.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Tell me again<br />What is your name?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti, sir.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>And you are Mantuan?&nbsp; Look to your wives, my lords,<br />When
such a gallant comes to Padua.<br />Thou dost well to laugh, Count Bardi;
I have noted<br />How merry is that husband by whose hearth<br />Sits
an uncomely wife.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>May it please your Grace,<br />The wives of Padua are above suspicion.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>What, are they so ill-favoured!&nbsp; Let us go,<br />This Cardinal
detains our pious Duchess;<br />His sermon and his beard want cutting
both:<br />Will you come with us, sir, and hear a text<br />From holy
Jerome?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[bowing]<br />My liege, there are some matters -</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[interrupting]<br />Thou need&rsquo;st make no excuse for missing
mass.<br />Come, gentlemen.<br />[Exit with his suite into Cathedral.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[after a pause]<br />So the Duke sold my father;<br />I kissed his
hand.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Thou shalt do that many times.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Must it be so?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! thou hast sworn an oath.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>That oath shall make me marble.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Farewell, boy,<br />Thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I pray thou comest quickly.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I will come<br />When it is time; be ready.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Fear me not.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Here is your friend; see that you banish him<br />Both from your
heart and Padua.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>From Padua,<br />Not from my heart.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Nay, from thy heart as well,<br />I will not leave thee till I see
thee do it.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Can I have no friend?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Revenge shall be thy friend;<br />Thou need&rsquo;st no other.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Well, then be it so.<br />[Enter ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Come, Guido, I have been beforehand with you in everything, for I
have drunk a flagon of wine, eaten a pasty, and kissed the maid who
served it.&nbsp; Why, you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot
buy apples, or a politician who cannot sell his vote.&nbsp; What news,
Guido, what news?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Why, that we two must part, Ascanio.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>That would be news indeed, but it is not true.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Too true it is, you must get hence, Ascanio,<br />And never look
upon my face again.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>No, no; indeed you do not know me, Guido;<br />&rsquo;Tis true I
am a common yeoman&rsquo;s son,<br />Nor versed in fashions of much
courtesy;<br />But, if you are nobly born, cannot I be<br />Your serving
man?&nbsp; I will tend you with more love<br />Than any hired servant.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[clasping his hand]<br />Ascanio!<br />[Sees MORANZONE looking at
him and drops ASCANIO&rsquo;S hand.]<br />It cannot be.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>What, is it so with you?<br />I thought the friendship of the antique
world<br />Was not yet dead, but that the Roman type<br />Might even
in this poor and common age<br />Find counterparts of love; then by
this love<br />Which beats between us like a summer sea,<br />Whatever
lot has fallen to your hand<br />May I not share it?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Share it?</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Ay!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Have you then come to some inheritance<br />Of lordly castle, or
of stored-up gold?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[bitterly]<br />Ay! I have come to my inheritance.<br />O bloody
legacy! and O murderous dole!<br />Which, like the thrifty miser, must
I hoard,<br />And to my own self keep; and so, I pray you,<br />Let
us part here.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>What, shall we never more<br />Sit hand in hand, as we were wont
to sit,<br />Over some book of ancient chivalry<br />Stealing a truant
holiday from school,<br />Follow the huntsmen through the autumn woods,<br />And
watch the falcons burst their tasselled jesses,<br />When the hare breaks
from covert.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Never more.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Must I go hence without a word of love?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>You must go hence, and may love go with you.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>You are unknightly, and ungenerous.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Unknightly and ungenerous if you will.<br />Why should we waste more
words about the matter<br />Let us part now.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Have you no message, Guido?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>None; my whole past was but a schoolboy&rsquo;s dream;<br />To-day
my life begins.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p>ASCANIO</p>
<p>Farewell [exit slowly.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Now are you satisfied?&nbsp; Have you not seen<br />My dearest friend,
and my most loved companion,<br />Thrust from me like a common kitchen
knave!<br />Oh, that I did it!&nbsp; Are you not satisfied?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! I am satisfied.&nbsp; Now I go hence,<br />Do not forget the
sign, your father&rsquo;s dagger,<br />And do the business when I send
it to you.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Be sure I shall.&nbsp; [Exit LORD MORANZONE.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O thou eternal heaven!<br />If there is aught of nature in my soul,<br />Of
gentle pity, or fond kindliness,<br />Wither it up, blast it, bring
it to nothing,<br />Or if thou wilt not, then will I myself<br />Cut
pity with a sharp knife from my heart<br />And strangle mercy in her
sleep at night<br />Lest she speak to me.&nbsp; Vengeance there I have
it.<br />Be thou my comrade and my bedfellow,<br />Sit by my side, ride
to the chase with me,<br />When I am weary sing me pretty songs,<br />When
I am light o&rsquo; heart, make jest with me,<br />And when I dream,
whisper into my ear<br />The dreadful secret of a father&rsquo;s murder
-<br />Did I say murder?&nbsp; [Draws his dagger.]<br />Listen, thou
terrible God!<br />Thou God that punishest all broken oaths,<br />And
bid some angel write this oath in fire,<br />That from this hour, till
my dear father&rsquo;s murder<br />In blood I have revenged, I do forswear<br />The
noble ties of honourable friendship,<br />The noble joys of dear companionship,<br />Affection&rsquo;s
bonds, and loyal gratitude,<br />Ay, more, from this same hour I do
forswear<br />All love of women, and the barren thing<br />Which men
call beauty -<br />[The organ peals in the Cathedral, and under a canopy
of cloth of silver tissue, borne by four pages in scarlet, the DUCHESS
OF PADUA comes down the steps; as she passes across their eyes meet
for a moment, and as she leaves the stage she looks back at GUIDO, and
the dagger falls from his hand.]<br />Oh! who is that?</p>
<p>A CITIZEN</p>
<p>The Duchess of Padua!</p>
<p>END OF ACT I.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ACT II</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>SCENE</p>
<p>A state room in the Ducal Palace, hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus; a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of red marble, through which one can see a view of Padua; a large canopy
is set (R.C.) with three thrones, one a little lower than the others;
the ceiling is made of long gilded beams; furniture of the period, chairs
covered with gilt leather, and buffets set with gold and silver plate,
and chests painted with mythological scenes.&nbsp; A number of the courtiers
is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below; from
the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of &lsquo;Death to the
Duke&rsquo;: after a little interval enter the Duke very calmly; he
is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti; with him enters also the Lord
Cardinal; the mob still shouting.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!<br />Why, she is worse than
ugly, she is good.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>[excitedly]<br />Your Grace, there are two thousand people there<br />Who
every moment grow more clamorous.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!<br />People
who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;<br />The only men I fear are
silent men.<br />[A yell from the people.]<br />You see, Lord Cardinal,
how my people love me.<br />[Another yell.]&nbsp; Go, Petrucci,<br />And
tell the captain of the guard below<br />To clear the square.&nbsp;
Do you not hear me, sir?<br />Do what I bid you.</p>
<p>[Exit PETRUCCI.]</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>I beseech your Grace<br />To listen to their grievances.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[sitting on his throne]<br />Ay! the peaches<br />Are not so big
this year as they were last.<br />I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,<br />I
thought you spake of peaches.<br />[A cheer from the people.]<br />What
is that?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[rushes to the window]<br />The Duchess has gone forth into the square,<br />And
stands between the people and the guard,<br />And will not let them
shoot.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>The devil take her!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[still at the window]<br />And followed by a dozen of the citizens<br />Has
come into the Palace.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[starting up]<br />By Saint James,<br />Our Duchess waxes bold!</p>
<p>BARDI</p>
<p>Here comes the Duchess.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.<br />[They close
the door on the corridor.]<br />[Enter the Duchess followed by a crowd
of meanly dressed Citizens.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[flinging herself upon her knees]<br />I do beseech your Grace to
give us audience.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>What are these grievances?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas, my Lord,<br />Such common things as neither you nor I,<br />Nor
any of these noble gentlemen,<br />Have ever need at all to think about;<br />They
say the bread, the very bread they eat,<br />Is made of sorry chaff.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Ay! so it is,<br />Nothing but chaff.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>And very good food too,<br />I give it to my horses.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[restraining herself]<br />They say the water,<br />Set in the public
cisterns for their use,<br />[Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]<br />To
stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>They should drink wine; water is quite unwholesome.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs<br />Take at the city
gate are grown so high<br />We cannot buy wine.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Then you should bless the taxes<br />Which make you temperate.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Think, while we sit<br />In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty<br />Creeps
through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives<br />Cuts the warm
throats of children stealthily<br />And no word said.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Ay! marry, that is true,<br />My little son died yesternight from
hunger;<br />He was but six years old; I am so poor,<br />I cannot bury
him.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>If you are poor,<br />Are you not blessed in that?&nbsp; Why, poverty<br />Is
one of the Christian virtues,<br />[Turns to the CARDINAL.]<br />Is
it not?<br />I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,<br />Rich
abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates<br />For preaching voluntary
poverty.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Nay but, my lord the Duke, be generous;<br />While we sit here within
a noble house<br />[With shaded porticoes against the sun,<br />And
walls and roofs to keep the winter out],<br />There are many citizens
of Padua<br />Who in vile tenements live so full of holes,<br />That
the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast,<br />Are tenants also
with them; others sleep<br />Under the arches of the public bridges<br />All
through the autumn nights, till the wet mist<br />Stiffens their limbs,
and fevers come, and so -</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>And so they go to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, Madam.<br />They should
thank me for sending them to Heaven,<br />If they are wretched here.<br />[To
the CARDINAL.]<br />Is it not said<br />Somewhere in Holy Writ, that
every man<br />Should be contented with that state of life<br />God
calls him to?&nbsp; Why should I change their state,<br />Or meddle
with an all-wise providence,<br />Which has apportioned that some men
should starve,<br />And others surfeit?&nbsp; I did not make the world.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>He hath a hard heart.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Nay, be silent, neighbour;<br />I think the Cardinal will speak for
us.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>True, it is Christian to bear misery,<br />Yet it is Christian also
to be kind,<br />And there seem many evils in this town,<br />Which
in your wisdom might your Grace reform.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>What is that word reform?&nbsp; What does it mean?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Marry, it means leaving things as they are; I like it not.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Reform Lord Cardinal, did <i>you</i> say reform?<br />There is a
man in Germany called Luther,<br />Who would reform the Holy Catholic
Church.<br />Have you not made him heretic, and uttered<br />Anathema,
maranatha, against him?</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>[rising from his seat]<br />He would have led the sheep out of the
fold,<br />We do but ask of you to feed the sheep.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>When I have shorn their fleeces I may feed them.<br />As for these
rebels -<br />[DUCHESS entreats him.]</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>That is a kind word,<br />He means to give us something.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>These ragged knaves who come before us here,<br />With mouths chock-full
of treason.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Good my Lord,<br />Fill up our mouths with bread; we&rsquo;ll hold
our tongues.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Ye shall hold your tongues, whether you starve or not.<br />My lords,
this age is so familiar grown,<br />That the low peasant hardly doffs
his hat,<br />Unless you beat him; and the raw mechanic<br />Elbows
the noble in the public streets.<br />[To the Citizens.]<br />Still
as our gentle Duchess has so prayed us,<br />And to refuse so beautiful
a beggar<br />Were to lack both courtesy and love,<br />Touching your
grievances, I promise this -</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Marry, he will lighten the taxes!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Or a dole of bread, think you, for each man?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>That, on next Sunday, the Lord Cardinal<br />Shall, after Holy Mass,
preach you a sermon<br />Upon the Beauty of Obedience.<br />[Citizens
murmur.]</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>I&rsquo; faith, that will not fill our stomachs!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>A sermon is but a sorry sauce, when<br />You have nothing to eat
with it.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Poor people,<br />You see I have no power with the Duke,<br />But
if you go into the court without,<br />My almoner shall from my private
purse,<br />Divide a hundred ducats &rsquo;mongst you all.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>God save the Duchess, say I.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>God save her.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And every Monday morn shall bread be set<br />For those who lack
it.<br />[Citizens applaud and go out.]</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>[going out]<br />Why, God save the Duchess again!</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[calling him back]<br />Come hither, fellow! what is your name?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Dominick, sir.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>A good name!&nbsp; Why were you called Dominick?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>[scratching his head]<br />Marry, because I was born on St. George&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>A good reason! here is a ducat for you!<br />Will you not cry for
me God save the Duke?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>[feebly]<br />God save the Duke.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Nay! louder, fellow, louder.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>[a little louder]<br />God save the Duke!</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>More lustily, fellow, put more heart in it!<br />Here is another
ducat for you.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>[enthusiastically]<br />God save the Duke!</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[mockingly]<br />Why, gentlemen, this simple fellow&rsquo;s love<br />Touches
me much.&nbsp; [To the Citizen, harshly.]<br />Go!&nbsp; [Exit Citizen,
bowing.]<br />This is the way, my lords,<br />You can buy popularity
nowadays.<br />Oh, we are nothing if not democratic!<br />[To the DUCHESS.]<br />Well,
Madam,<br />You spread rebellion &rsquo;midst our citizens.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,<br />The right to
pity, and the right to mercy.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>So, so, you argue with me?&nbsp; This is she,<br />The gentle Duchess
for whose hand I yielded<br />Three of the fairest towns in Italy,<br />Pisa,
and Genoa, and Orvieto.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter<br />Brake you your
word as ever.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>You wrong us, Madam,<br />There were state reasons.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What state reasons are there<br />For breaking holy promises to a
state?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest<br />Close to the city:
when I promised Pisa<br />Unto your noble and most trusting father,<br />I
had forgotten there was hunting there.<br />At Genoa they say,<br />Indeed
I doubt them not, that the red mullet<br />Runs larger in the harbour
of that town<br />Than anywhere in Italy.<br />[Turning to one of the
Court.]<br />You, my lord,<br />Whose gluttonous appetite is your only
god,<br />Could satisfy our Duchess on that point.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And Orvieto?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[yawning]<br />I cannot now recall<br />Why I did not surrender Orvieto<br />According
to the word of my contract.<br />Maybe it was because I did not choose.<br />[Goes
over to the DUCHESS.]<br />Why look you, Madam, you are here alone;<br />&rsquo;Tis
many a dusty league to your grey France,<br />And even there your father
barely keeps<br />A hundred ragged squires for his Court.<br />What
hope have you, I say?&nbsp; Which of these lords<br />And noble gentlemen
of Padua<br />Stands by your side.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>There is not one.</p>
<p>[GUIDO starts, but restrains himself.]</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Nor shall be,<br />While I am Duke in Padua: listen, Madam,<br />Being
mine own, you shall do as I will,<br />And if it be my will you keep
the house,<br />Why then, this palace shall your prison be;<br />And
if it be my will you walk abroad,<br />Why, you shall take the air from
morn to night.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Sir, by what right -?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Madam, my second Duchess<br />Asked the same question once: her monument<br />Lies
in the chapel of Bartholomew,<br />Wrought in red marble; very beautiful.<br />Guido,
your arm.&nbsp; Come, gentlemen, let us go<br />And spur our falcons
for the mid-day chase.<br />Bethink you, Madam, you are here alone.<br />[Exit
the DUKE leaning on GUIDO, with his Court.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[looking after them]<br />The Duke said rightly that I was alone;<br />Deserted,
and dishonoured, and defamed,<br />Stood ever woman so alone indeed?<br />Men
when they woo us call us pretty children,<br />Tell us we have not wit
to make our lives,<br />And so they mar them for us.&nbsp; Did I say
woo?<br />We are their chattels, and their common slaves,<br />Less
dear than the poor hound that licks their hand,<br />Less fondled than
the hawk upon their wrist.<br />Woo, did I say? bought rather, sold
and bartered,<br />Our very bodies being merchandise.<br />I know it
is the general lot of women,<br />Each miserably mated to some man<br />Wrecks
her own life upon his selfishness:<br />That it is general makes it
not less bitter.<br />I think I never heard a woman laugh,<br />Laugh
for pure merriment, except one woman,<br />That was at night time, in
the public streets.<br />Poor soul, she walked with painted lips, and
wore<br />The mask of pleasure: I would not laugh like her;<br />No,
death were better.<br />[Enter GUIDO behind unobserved; the DUCHESS
flings herself down before a picture of the Madonna.]<br />O Mary mother,
with your sweet pale face<br />Bending between the little angel heads<br />That
hover round you, have you no help for me?<br />Mother of God, have you
no help for me?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I can endure no longer.<br />This is my love, and I will speak to
her.<br />Lady, am I a stranger to your prayers?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[rising]<br />None but the wretched needs my prayers, my lord.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Then must I need them, lady.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>How is that?<br />Does not the Duke show thee sufficient honour?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Your Grace, I lack no favours from the Duke,<br />Whom my soul loathes
as I loathe wickedness,<br />But come to proffer on my bended knees,<br />My
loyal service to thee unto death.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; I am so fallen in estate<br />I can but give thee a poor
meed of thanks.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[seizing her hand]<br />Hast thou no love to give me?<br />[The DUCHESS
starts, and GUIDO falls at her feet.]<br />O dear saint,<br />If I have
been too daring, pardon me!<br />Thy beauty sets my boyish blood aflame,<br />And,
when my reverent lips touch thy white hand,<br />Each little nerve with
such wild passion thrills<br />That there is nothing which I would not
do<br />To gain thy love.&nbsp; [Leaps up.]<br />Bid me reach forth
and pluck<br />Perilous honour from the lion&rsquo;s jaws,<br />And
I will wrestle with the Nemean beast<br />On the bare desert!&nbsp;
Fling to the cave of War<br />A gaud, a ribbon, a dead flower, something<br />That
once has touched thee, and I&rsquo;ll bring it back<br />Though all
the hosts of Christendom were there,<br />Inviolate again! ay, more
than this,<br />Set me to scale the pallid white-faced cliffs<br />Of
mighty England, and from that arrogant shield<br />Will I raze out the
lilies of your France<br />Which England, that sea-lion of the sea,<br />Hath
taken from her!<br />O dear Beatrice,<br />Drive me not from thy presence!
without thee<br />The heavy minutes crawl with feet of lead,<br />But,
while I look upon thy loveliness,<br />The hours fly like winged Mercuries<br />And
leave existence golden.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I did not think<br />I should be ever loved: do you indeed<br />Love
me so much as now you say you do?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea,<br />Ask of the roses if
they love the rain,<br />Ask of the little lark, that will not sing<br />Till
day break, if it loves to see the day:-<br />And yet, these are but
empty images,<br />Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire<br />So
great that all the waters of the main<br />Can not avail to quench it.&nbsp;
Will you not speak?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I hardly know what I should say to you.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Will you not say you love me?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Is that my lesson?<br />Must I say all at once?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere
a good lesson<br />If I did love you, sir; but, if I do not,<br />What
shall I say then?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>If you do not love me,<br />Say, none the less, you do, for on your
tongue<br />Falsehood for very shame would turn to truth.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What if I do not speak at all?&nbsp; They say<br />Lovers are happiest
when they are in doubt</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, doubt would kill me, and if I must die,<br />Why, let me die
for joy and not for doubt.<br />Oh, tell me may I stay, or must I go?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I would not have you either stay or go;<br />For if you stay you
steal my love from me,<br />And if you go you take my love away.<br />Guido,
though all the morning stars could sing<br />They could not tell the
measure of my love.<br />I love you, Guido.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[stretching out his hands]<br />Oh, do not cease at all;<br />I thought
the nightingale sang but at night;<br />Or if thou needst must cease,
then let my lips<br />Touch the sweet lips that can such music make.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>To touch my lips is not to touch my heart.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Do you close that against me?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas! my lord,<br />I have it not: the first day that I saw you<br />I
let you take my heart away from me;<br />Unwilling thief, that without
meaning it<br />Did break into my fenced treasury<br />And filch my
jewel from it!&nbsp; O strange theft,<br />Which made you richer though
you knew it not,<br />And left me poorer, and yet glad of it!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[clasping her in his arms]<br />O love, love, love!&nbsp; Nay, sweet,
lift up your head,<br />Let me unlock those little scarlet doors<br />That
shut in music, let me dive for coral<br />In your red lips, and I&rsquo;ll
bear back a prize<br />Richer than all the gold the Gryphon guards<br />In
rude Armenia.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>You are my lord,<br />And what I have is yours, and what I have not<br />Your
fancy lends me, like a prodigal<br />Spending its wealth on what is
nothing worth.<br />[Kisses him.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Methinks I am bold to look upon you thus:<br />The gentle violet
hides beneath its leaf<br />And is afraid to look at the great sun<br />For
fear of too much splendour, but my eyes,<br />O daring eyes! are grown
so venturous<br />That like fixed stars they stand, gazing at you,<br />And
surfeit sense with beauty.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Dear love, I would<br />You could look upon me ever, for your eyes<br />Are
polished mirrors, and when I peer<br />Into those mirrors I can see
myself,<br />And so I know my image lives in you.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[taking her in his arms]<br />Stand still, thou hurrying orb in the
high heavens,<br />And make this hour immortal!&nbsp; [A pause.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Sit down here,<br />A little lower than me: yes, just so, sweet,<br />That
I may run my fingers through your hair,<br />And see your face turn
upwards like a flower<br />To meet my kiss.<br />Have you not sometimes
noted,<br />When we unlock some long-disus&eacute;d room<br />With heavy
dust and soiling mildew filled,<br />Where never foot of man has come
for years,<br />And from the windows take the rusty bar,<br />And fling
the broken shutters to the air,<br />And let the bright sun in, how
the good sun<br />Turns every grimy particle of dust<br />Into a little
thing of dancing gold?<br />Guido, my heart is that long-empty room,<br />But
you have let love in, and with its gold<br />Gilded all life.&nbsp;
Do you not think that love<br />Fills up the sum of life?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ay! without love<br />Life is no better than the unhewn stone<br />Which
in the quarry lies, before the sculptor<br />Has set the God within
it.&nbsp; Without love<br />Life is as silent as the common reeds<br />That
through the marshes or by rivers grow,<br />And have no music in them.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Yet out of these<br />The singer, who is Love, will make a pipe<br />And
from them he draws music; so I think<br />Love will bring music out
of any life.<br />Is that not true?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Sweet, women make it true.<br />There are men who paint pictures,
and carve statues,<br />Paul of Verona and the dyer&rsquo;s son,<br />Or
their great rival, who, by the sea at Venice,<br />Has set God&rsquo;s
little maid upon the stair,<br />White as her own white lily, and as
tall,<br />Or Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine<br />Because they are
mothers merely; yet I think<br />Women are the best artists of the world,<br />For
they can take the common lives of men<br />Soiled with the money-getting
of our age,<br />And with love make them beautiful.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ah, dear,<br />I wish that you and I were very poor;<br />The poor,
who love each other, are so rich.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Tell me again you love me, Beatrice.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[fingering his collar]<br />How well this collar lies about your
throat.<br />[LORD MORANZONE looks through the door from the corridor
outside.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, tell me that you love me.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I remember,<br />That when I was a child in my dear France,<br />Being
at Court at Fontainebleau, the King<br />Wore such a collar.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Will you not say you love me?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[smiling]<br />He was a very royal man, King Francis,<br />Yet he
was not royal as you are.<br />Why need I tell you, Guido, that I love
you?<br />[Takes his head in her hands and turns his face up to her.]<br />Do
you not know that I am yours for ever,<br />Body and soul?<br />[Kisses
him, and then suddenly catches sight of MORANZONE and leaps up.]<br />Oh,
what is that?&nbsp; [MORANZONE disappears.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What, love?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Methought I saw a face with eyes of flame<br />Look at us through
the doorway.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, &rsquo;twas nothing:<br />The passing shadow of the man on guard.<br />[The
DUCHESS still stands looking at the window.]<br />&rsquo;Twas nothing,
sweet.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay! what can harm us now,<br />Who are in Love&rsquo;s hand?&nbsp;
I do not think I&rsquo;d care<br />Though the vile world should with
its lackey Slander<br />Trample and tread upon my life; why should I?<br />They
say the common field-flowers of the field<br />Have sweeter scent when
they are trodden on<br />Than when they bloom alone, and that some herbs<br />Which
have no perfume, on being bruis&eacute;d die<br />With all Arabia round
them; so it is<br />With the young lives this dull world seeks to crush,<br />It
does but bring the sweetness out of them,<br />And makes them lovelier
often.&nbsp; And besides,<br />While we have love we have the best of
life:<br />Is it not so?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Dear, shall we play or sing?<br />I think that I could sing now.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Do not speak,<br />For there are times when all existences<br />Seem
narrowed to one single ecstasy,<br />And Passion sets a seal upon the
lips.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, with mine own lips let me break that seal!<br />You love me,
Beatrice?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay! is it not strange<br />I should so love mine enemy?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Why, you: that with your shaft did pierce my heart!<br />Poor heart,
that lived its little lonely life<br />Until it met your arrow.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ah, dear love,<br />I am so wounded by that bolt myself<br />That
with untended wounds I lie a-dying,<br />Unless you cure me, dear Physician.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I would not have you cured; for I am sick<br />With the same malady.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, how I love you!<br />See, I must steal the cuckoo&rsquo;s voice,
and tell<br />The one tale over.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Tell no other tale!<br />For, if that is the little cuckoo&rsquo;s
song,<br />The nightingale is hoarse, and the loud lark<br />Has lost
its music.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Kiss me, Beatrice!<br />[She takes his face in her hands and bends
down and kisses him; a loud knocking then comes at the door, and GUIDO
leaps up; enter a Servant.]</p>
<p>SERVANT</p>
<p>A package for you, sir.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[carelessly]&nbsp; Ah! give it to me.&nbsp; [Servant hands package
wrapped in vermilion silk, and exit; as GUIDO is about to open it the
DUCHESS comes up behind, and in sport takes it from him.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[laughing]<br />Now I will wager it is from some girl<br />Who would
have you wear her favour; I am so jealous<br />I will not give up the
least part in you,<br />But like a miser keep you to myself,<br />And
spoil you perhaps in keeping.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It is nothing.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Nay, it is from some girl.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>You know &rsquo;tis not.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[turns her back and opens it]<br />Now, traitor, tell me what does
this sign mean,<br />A dagger with two leopards wrought in steel?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[taking it from her]&nbsp; O God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll from the window look, and try<br />If I can&rsquo;t see
the porter&rsquo;s livery<br />Who left it at the gate!&nbsp; I will
not rest<br />Till I have learned your secret.<br />[Runs laughing into
the corridor.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, horrible!<br />Had I so soon forgot my father&rsquo;s death,<br />Did
I so soon let love into my heart,<br />And must I banish love, and let
in murder<br />That beats and clamours at the outer gate?<br />Ay, that
I must!&nbsp; Have I not sworn an oath?<br />Yet not to-night; nay,
it must be to-night.<br />Farewell then all the joy and light of life,<br />All
dear recorded memories, farewell,<br />Farewell all love!&nbsp; Could
I with bloody hands<br />Fondle and paddle with her innocent hands?<br />Could
I with lips fresh from this butchery<br />Play with her lips?&nbsp;
Could I with murderous eyes<br />Look in those violet eyes, whose purity<br />Would
strike men blind, and make each eyeball reel<br />In night perpetual?&nbsp;
No, murder has set<br />A barrier between us far too high<br />For us
to kiss across it.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Guido!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Beatrice,<br />You must forget that name, and banish me<br />Out
of your life for ever.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[going towards him]<br />O dear love!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[stepping back]<br />There lies a barrier between us two<br />We
dare not pass.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I dare do anything<br />So that you are beside me.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; There it is,<br />I cannot be beside you, cannot breathe<br />The
air you breathe; I cannot any more<br />Stand face to face with beauty,
which unnerves<br />My shaking heart, and makes my desperate hand<br />Fail
of its purpose.&nbsp; Let me go hence, I pray;<br />Forget you ever
looked upon me.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What!<br />With your hot kisses fresh upon my lips<br />Forget the
vows of love you made to me?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I take them back.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas, you cannot, Guido,<br />For they are part of nature now; the
air<br />Is tremulous with their music, and outside<br />The little
birds sing sweeter for those vows.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>There lies a barrier between us now,<br />Which then I knew not,
or I had forgot.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>There is no barrier, Guido; why, I will go<br />In poor attire, and
will follow you<br />Over the world.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[wildly]<br />The world&rsquo;s not wide enough<br />To hold us two!&nbsp;
Farewell, farewell for ever.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[calm, and controlling her passion]<br />Why did you come into my
life at all, then,<br />Or in the desolate garden of my heart<br />Sow
that white flower of love -?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O Beatrice!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Which now you would dig up, uproot, tear out,<br />Though each small
fibre doth so hold my heart<br />That if you break one, my heart breaks
with it?<br />Why did you come into my life?&nbsp; Why open<br />The
secret wells of love I had sealed up?<br />Why did you open them -?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[clenching her hand]<br />And let<br />The floodgates of my passion
swell and burst<br />Till, like the wave when rivers overflow<br />That
sweeps the forest and the farm away,<br />Love in the splendid avalanche
of its might<br />Swept my life with it?&nbsp; Must I drop by drop<br />Gather
these waters back and seal them up?<br />Alas!&nbsp; Each drop will
be a tear, and so<br />Will with its saltness make life very bitter.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I pray you speak no more, for I must go<br />Forth from your life
and love, and make a way<br />On which you cannot follow.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I have heard<br />That sailors dying of thirst upon a raft,<br />Poor
castaways upon a lonely sea,<br />Dream of green fields and pleasant
water-courses,<br />And then wake up with red thirst in their throats,<br />And
die more miserably because sleep<br />Has cheated them: so they die
cursing sleep<br />For having sent them dreams: I will not curse you<br />Though
I am cast away upon the sea<br />Which men call Desolation.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God, God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>But you will stay: listen, I love you, Guido.<br />[She waits a little.]<br />Is
echo dead, that when I say I love you<br />There is no answer?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Everything is dead,<br />Save one thing only, which shall die to-night!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>If you are going, touch me not, but go.<br />[Exit GUIDO.]<br />Barrier!&nbsp;
Barrier!<br />Why did he say there was a barrier?<br />There is no barrier
between us two.<br />He lied to me, and shall I for that reason<br />Loathe
what I love, and what I worshipped, hate?<br />I think we women do not
love like that.<br />For if I cut his image from my heart,<br />My heart
would, like a bleeding pilgrim, follow<br />That image through the world,
and call it back<br />With little cries of love.<br />[Enter DUKE equipped
for the chase, with falconers and hounds.]</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>Madam, you keep us waiting;<br />You keep my dogs waiting.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I will not ride to-day.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>How now, what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>My Lord, I cannot go.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>What, pale face, do you dare to stand against me?<br />Why, I could
set you on a sorry jade<br />And lead you through the town, till the
low rabble<br />You feed toss up their hats and mock at you.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Have you no word of kindness ever for me?</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>I hold you in the hollow of my hand<br />And have no need on you
to waste kind words.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Well, I will go.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>[slapping his boot with his whip]<br />No, I have changed my mind,<br />You
will stay here, and like a faithful wife<br />Watch from the window
for our coming back.<br />Were it not dreadful if some accident<br />By
chance should happen to your loving Lord?<br />Come, gentlemen, my hounds
begin to chafe,<br />And I chafe too, having a patient wife.<br />Where
is young Guido?</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>My liege, I have not seen him<br />For a full hour past.</p>
<p>DUKE</p>
<p>It matters not,<br />I dare say I shall see him soon enough.<br />Well,
Madam, you will sit at home and spin.<br />I do protest, sirs, the domestic
virtues<br />Are often very beautiful in others.</p>
<p>[Exit DUKE with his Court.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>The stars have fought against me, that is all,<br />And thus to-night
when my Lord lieth asleep,<br />Will I fall upon my dagger, and so cease.<br />My
heart is such a stone nothing can reach it<br />Except the dagger&rsquo;s
edge: let it go there,<br />To find what name it carries: ay! to-night<br />Death
will divorce the Duke; and yet to-night<br />He may die also, he is
very old.<br />Why should he not die?&nbsp; Yesterday his hand<br />Shook
with a palsy: men have died from palsy,<br />And why not he?&nbsp; Are
there not fevers also,<br />Agues and chills, and other maladies<br />Most
incident to old age?<br />No, no, he will not die, he is too sinful;<br />Honest
men die before their proper time.<br />Good men will die: men by whose
side the Duke<br />In all the sick pollution of his life<br />Seems
like a leper: women and children die,<br />But the Duke will not die,
he is too sinful.<br />Oh, can it be<br />There is some immortality
in sin,<br />Which virtue has not?&nbsp; And does the wicked man<br />Draw
life from what to other men were death,<br />Like poisonous plants that
on corruption live?<br />No, no, I think God would not suffer that:<br />Yet
the Duke will not die: he is too sinful.<br />But I will die alone,
and on this night<br />Grim Death shall be my bridegroom, and the tomb<br />My
secret house of pleasure: well, what of that?<br />The world&rsquo;s
a graveyard, and we each, like coffins,<br />Within us bear a skeleton.<br />[Enter
LORD MORANZONE all in black; he passes across the back of the stage
looking anxiously about.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Where is Guido?<br />I cannot find him anywhere.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[catches sight of him]&nbsp; O God!<br />&rsquo;Twas thou who took
my love away from me.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[with a look of joy]<br />What, has he left you?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Nay, you know he has.<br />Oh, give him back to me, give him back,
I say,<br />Or I will tear your body limb from limb,<br />And to the
common gibbet nail your head<br />Until the carrion crows have stripped
it bare.<br />Better you had crossed a hungry lioness<br />Before you
came between me and my love.<br />[With more pathos.]<br />Nay, give
him back, you know not how I love him.<br />Here by this chair he knelt
a half hour since;<br />&rsquo;Twas there he stood, and there he looked
at me;<br />This is the hand he kissed, and these the ears<br />Into
whose open portals he did pour<br />A tale of love so musical that all<br />The
birds stopped singing!&nbsp; Oh, give him back to me.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>He does not love you, Madam.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>May the plague<br />Wither the tongue that says so!&nbsp; Give him
back.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Madam, I tell you you will never see him,<br />Neither to-night,
nor any other night.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What is your name?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>My name?&nbsp; Revenge!<br />[Exit.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Revenge!<br />I think I never harmed a little child.<br />What should
Revenge do coming to my door?<br />It matters not, for Death is there
already,<br />Waiting with his dim torch to light my way.<br />&rsquo;Tis
true men hate thee, Death, and yet I think<br />Thou wilt be kinder
to me than my lover,<br />And so dispatch the messengers at once,<br />Harry
the lazy steeds of lingering day,<br />And let the night, thy sister,
come instead,<br />And drape the world in mourning; let the owl,<br />Who
is thy minister, scream from his tower<br />And wake the toad with hooting,
and the bat,<br />That is the slave of dim Persephone,<br />Wheel through
the sombre air on wandering wing!<br />Tear up the shrieking mandrakes
from the earth<br />And bid them make us music, and tell the mole<br />To
dig deep down thy cold and narrow bed,<br />For I shall lie within thine
arms to-night.</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>SCENE</p>
<p>A large corridor in the Ducal Palace: a window (L.C.) looks out on
a view of Padua by moonlight: a staircase (R.C.) leads up to a door
with a porti&egrave;re of crimson velvet, with the Duke&rsquo;s arms
embroidered in gold on it: on the lowest step of the staircase a figure
draped in black is sitting: the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled
with burning tow: thunder and lightning outside: the time is night.</p>
<p>[Enter GUIDO through the window.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>The wind is rising: how my ladder shook!<br />I thought that every
gust would break the cords!<br />[Looks out at the city.]<br />Christ!&nbsp;
What a night:<br />Great thunder in the heavens, and wild lightnings<br />Striking
from pinnacle to pinnacle<br />Across the city, till the dim houses
seem<br />To shudder and to shake as each new glare<br />Dashes adown
the street.<br />[Passes across the stage to foot of staircase.]<br />Ah!
who art thou<br />That sittest on the stair, like unto Death<br />Waiting
a guilty soul?&nbsp; [A pause.]<br />Canst thou not speak?<br />Or has
this storm laid palsy on thy tongue,<br />And chilled thy utterance?<br />[The
figure rises and takes off his mask.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti,<br />Thy murdered father laughs for joy to-night.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[confusedly]<br />What, art thou here?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay, waiting for your coming.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[looking away from him]<br />I did not think to see you, but am glad,<br />That
you may know the thing I mean to do.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>First, I would have you know my well-laid plans;<br />Listen: I have
set horses at the gate<br />Which leads to Parma: when you have done
your business<br />We will ride hence, and by to-morrow night -</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It cannot be.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Nay, but it shall.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Listen, Lord Moranzone,<br />I am resolved not to kill this man.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Surely my ears are traitors, speak again:<br />It cannot be but age
has dulled my powers,<br />I am an old man now: what did you say?<br />You
said that with that dagger in your belt<br />You would avenge your father&rsquo;s
bloody murder;<br />Did you not say that?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No, my lord, I said<br />I was resolved not to kill the Duke.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>You said not that; it is my senses mock me;<br />Or else this midnight
air o&rsquo;ercharged with storm<br />Alters your message in the giving
it.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, you heard rightly; I&rsquo;ll not kill this man.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What of thine oath, thou traitor, what of thine oath?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I am resolved not to keep that oath.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What of thy murdered father?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Dost thou think<br />My father would be glad to see me coming,<br />This
old man&rsquo;s blood still hot upon mine hands?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ay! he would laugh for joy.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I do not think so,<br />There is better knowledge in the other world;<br />Vengeance
is God&rsquo;s, let God himself revenge.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Thou art God&rsquo;s minister of vengeance.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No!<br />God hath no minister but his own hand.<br />I will not kill
this man.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Why are you here,<br />If not to kill him, then?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Lord Moranzone,<br />I purpose to ascend to the Duke&rsquo;s chamber,<br />And
as he lies asleep lay on his breast<br />The dagger and this writing;
when he awakes<br />Then he will know who held him in his power<br />And
slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance<br />Which I can take.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>You will not slay him?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Ignoble son of a noble father,<br />Who sufferest this man who sold
that father<br />To live an hour.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas thou that hindered me;<br />I would have killed him in
the open square,<br />The day I saw him first.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>It was not yet time;<br />Now it is time, and, like some green-faced
girl,<br />Thou pratest of forgiveness.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No! revenge:<br />The right revenge my father&rsquo;s son should
take.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>You are a coward,<br />Take out the knife, get to the Duke&rsquo;s
chamber,<br />And bring me back his heart upon the blade.<br />When
he is dead, then you can talk to me<br />Of noble vengeances.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Upon thine honour,<br />And by the love thou bearest my father&rsquo;s
name,<br />Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman,<br />That
generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord,<br />Would have crept at
night-time, like a common thief,<br />And stabbed an old man sleeping
in his bed,<br />However he had wronged him: tell me that.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[after some hesitation]<br />You have sworn an oath, see that you
keep that oath.<br />Boy, do you think I do not know your secret,<br />Your
traffic with the Duchess?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Silence, liar!<br />The very moon in heaven is not more chaste.<br />Nor
the white stars so pure.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>And yet, you love her;<br />Weak fool, to let love in upon your life,<br />Save
as a plaything.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>You do well to talk:<br />Within your veins, old man, the pulse of
youth<br />Throbs with no ardour.&nbsp; Your eyes full of rheum<br />Have
against Beauty closed their filmy doors,<br />And your clogged ears,
losing their natural sense,<br />Have shut you from the music of the
world.<br />You talk of love!&nbsp; You know not what it is.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Oh, in my time, boy, have I walked i&rsquo; the moon,<br />Swore
I would live on kisses and on blisses,<br />Swore I would die for love,
and did not die,<br />Wrote love bad verses; ay, and sung them badly,<br />Like
all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks!<br />I know the partings
and the chamberings;<br />We are all animals at best, and love<br />Is
merely passion with a holy name.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Now then I know you have not loved at all.<br />Love is the sacrament
of life; it sets<br />Virtue where virtue was not; cleanses men<br />Of
all the vile pollutions of this world;<br />It is the fire which purges
gold from dross,<br />It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff,<br />It
is the spring which in some wintry soil<br />Makes innocence to blossom
like a rose.<br />The days are over when God walked with men,<br />But
Love, which is his image, holds his place.<br />When a man loves a woman,
then he knows<br />God&rsquo;s secret, and the secret of the world.<br />There
is no house so lowly or so mean,<br />Which, if their hearts be pure
who live in it,<br />Love will not enter; but if bloody murder<br />Knock
at the Palace gate and is let in,<br />Love like a wounded thing creeps
out and dies.<br />This is the punishment God sets on sin.<br />The
wicked cannot love.<br />[A groan comes from the DUKE&rsquo;s chamber.]<br />Ah!&nbsp;
What is that?<br />Do you not hear?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nothing.<br />So
I think<br />That it is woman&rsquo;s mission by their love<br />To
save the souls of men: and loving her,<br />My Lady, my white Beatrice,
I begin<br />To see a nobler and a holier vengeance<br />In letting
this man live, than doth reside<br />In bloody deeds o&rsquo; night,
stabs in the dark,<br />And young hands clutching at a palsied throat.<br />It
was, I think, for love&rsquo;s sake that Lord Christ,<br />Who was indeed
himself incarnate Love,<br />Bade every man forgive his enemy.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[sneeringly]<br />That was in Palestine, not Padua;<br />And said
for saints: I have to do with men.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It was for all time said.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>And your white Duchess,<br />What will she do to thank you?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Alas, I will not see her face again.<br />&rsquo;Tis but twelve hours
since I parted from her,<br />So suddenly, and with such violent passion,<br />That
she has shut her heart against me now:<br />No, I will never see her.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What will you do?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>After that I have laid the dagger there,<br />Get hence to-night
from Padua.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>And then?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I will take service with the Doge at Venice,<br />And bid him pack
me straightway to the wars,<br />And there I will, being now sick of
life,<br />Throw that poor life against some desperate spear.<br />[A
groan from the DUKE&rsquo;S chamber again.]<br />Did you not hear a
voice?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I always hear,<br />From the dim confines of some sepulchre,<br />A
voice that cries for vengeance.&nbsp; We waste time,<br />It will be
morning soon; are you resolved<br />You will not kill the Duke?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I am resolved.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>O wretched father, lying unavenged.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>More wretched, were thy son a murderer.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Why, what is life?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I do not know, my lord,<br />I did not give it, and I dare not take
it.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I do not thank God often; but I think<br />I thank him now that I
have got no son!<br />And you, what bastard blood flows in your veins<br />That
when you have your enemy in your grasp<br />You let him go!&nbsp; I
would that I had left you<br />With the dull hinds that reared you.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Better perhaps<br />That you had done so!&nbsp; May be better still<br />I&rsquo;d
not been born to this distressful world.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Farewell!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Farewell!&nbsp; Some day, Lord Moranzone,<br />You will understand
my vengeance.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Never, boy.<br />[Gets out of window and exit by rope ladder.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Father, I think thou knowest my resolve,<br />And with this nobler
vengeance art content.<br />Father, I think in letting this man live<br />That
I am doing what thou wouldst have done.<br />Father, I know not if a
human voice<br />Can pierce the iron gateway of the dead,<br />Or if
the dead are set in ignorance<br />Of what we do, or do not, for their
sakes.<br />And yet I feel a presence in the air,<br />There is a shadow
standing at my side,<br />And ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips,<br />And
leave them holier.&nbsp; [Kneels down.]<br />O father, if &rsquo;tis
thou,<br />Canst thou not burst through the decrees of death,<br />And
if corporeal semblance show thyself,<br />That I may touch thy hand!<br />No,
there is nothing.&nbsp; [Rises.]<br />&rsquo;Tis the night that cheats
us with its phantoms,<br />And, like a puppet-master, makes us think<br />That
things are real which are not.&nbsp; It grows late.<br />Now must I
to my business.<br />[Pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads
it.]<br />When he wakes,<br />And sees this letter, and the dagger with
it,<br />Will he not have some loathing for his life,<br />Repent, perchance,
and lead a better life,<br />Or will he mock because a young man spared<br />His
natural enemy?&nbsp; I do not care.<br />Father, it is thy bidding that
I do,<br />Thy bidding, and the bidding of my love<br />Which teaches
me to know thee as thou art.<br />[Ascends staircase stealthily, and
just as he reaches out his hand to draw back the curtain the Duchess
appears all in white.&nbsp; GUIDO starts back.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Guido! what do you here so late?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O white and spotless angel of my life,<br />Sure thou hast come from
Heaven with a message<br />That mercy is more noble than revenge?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>There is no barrier between us now.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>None, love, nor shall be.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I have seen to that.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Tarry here for me.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, you are not going?<br />You will not leave me as you did before?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I will return within a moment&rsquo;s space,<br />But first I must
repair to the Duke&rsquo;s chamber,<br />And leave this letter and this
dagger there,<br />That when he wakes -</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>When who wakes?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Why, the Duke.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>He will not wake again.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What, is he dead?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay! he is dead.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God! how wonderful<br />Are all thy secret ways!&nbsp; Who would
have said<br />That on this very night, when I had yielded<br />Into
thy hands the vengeance that is thine,<br />Thou with thy finger wouldst
have touched the man,<br />And bade him come before thy judgment seat.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I have just killed him.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[in horror]&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>He was asleep;<br />Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.<br />I
had resolved to kill myself to-night.<br />About an hour ago I waked
from sleep,<br />And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,<br />Where
I had hidden it to serve my need,<br />And drew it from the sheath,
and felt the edge,<br />And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,<br />And
turned to fall upon it, when I marked<br />The old man sleeping, full
of years and sin;<br />There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,<br />And
as I looked upon his evil face<br />Suddenly like a flame there flashed
across me,<br />There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:<br />You
said there lay a barrier between us,<br />What barrier but he? -<br />I
hardly know<br />What happened, but a steaming mist of blood<br />Rose
up between us two.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Oh, horrible!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And then he groaned,<br />And then he groaned no more!&nbsp; I only
heard<br />The dripping of the blood upon the floor.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Enough, enough.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Will you not kiss me now?<br />Do you remember saying that women&rsquo;s
love<br />Turns men to angels? well, the love of man<br />Turns women
into martyrs; for its sake<br />We do or suffer anything.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Will you not speak?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I cannot speak at all.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Let as not talk of this!&nbsp; Let us go hence:<br />Is not the barrier
broken down between us?<br />What would you more?&nbsp; Come, it is
almost morning.<br />[Puts her hand on GUIDO&rsquo;S.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[breaking from her]<br />O damned saint!&nbsp; O angel fresh from
Hell!<br />What bloody devil tempted thee to this!<br />That thou hast
killed thy husband, that is nothing -<br />Hell was already gaping for
his soul -<br />But thou hast murdered Love, and in its place<br />Hast
set a horrible and bloodstained thing,<br />Whose very breath breeds
pestilence and plague,<br />And strangles Love.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[in amazed wonder]<br />I did it all for you.<br />I would not have
you do it, had you willed it,<br />For I would keep you without blot
or stain,<br />A thing unblemished, unassailed, untarnished.<br />Men
do not know what women do for love.<br />Have I not wrecked my soul
for your dear sake,<br />Here and hereafter?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No, do not touch me,<br />Between us lies a thin red stream of blood;<br />I
dare not look across it: when you stabbed him<br />You stabbed Love
with a sharp knife to the heart.<br />We cannot meet again.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[wringing her hands]<br />For you!&nbsp; For you!<br />I did it all
for you: have you forgotten?<br />You said there was a barrier between
us;<br />That barrier lies now i&rsquo; the upper chamber<br />Upset,
overthrown, beaten, and battered down,<br />And will not part us ever.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>No, you mistook:<br />Sin was the barrier, you have raised it up;<br />Crime
was the barrier, you have set it there.<br />The barrier was murder,
and your hand<br />Has builded it so high it shuts out heaven,<br />It
shuts out God.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I did it all for you;<br />You dare not leave me now: nay, Guido,
listen.<br />Get horses ready, we will fly to-night.<br />The past is
a bad dream, we will forget it:<br />Before us lies the future: shall
we not have<br />Sweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh? -<br />No,
no, we will not laugh, but, when we weep,<br />Well, we will weep together;
I will serve you;<br />I will be very meek and very gentle:<br />You
do not know me.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, I know you now;<br />Get hence, I say, out of my sight.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[pacing up and down]<br />O God,<br />How I have loved this man!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>You never loved me.<br />Had it been so, Love would have stayed your
hand.<br />How could we sit together at Love&rsquo;s table?<br />You
have poured poison in the sacred wine,<br />And Murder dips his fingers
in the sop.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[throws herself on her knees]<br />Then slay me now!&nbsp; I have
spilt blood to-night,<br />You shall spill more, so we go hand in hand<br />To
heaven or to hell.&nbsp; Draw your sword, Guido.<br />Quick, let your
soul go chambering in my heart,<br />It will but find its master&rsquo;s
image there.<br />Nay, if you will not slay me with your sword,<br />Bid
me to fall upon this reeking knife,<br />And I will do it.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[wresting knife from her]<br />Give it to me, I say.<br />O God,
your very hands are wet with blood!<br />This place is Hell, I cannot
tarry here.<br />I pray you let me see your face no more.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Better for me I had not seen your face.<br />[GUIDO recoils: she
seizes his hands as she kneels.]<br />Nay, Guido, listen for a while:<br />Until
you came to Padua I lived<br />Wretched indeed, but with no murderous
thought,<br />Very submissive to a cruel Lord,<br />Very obedient to
unjust commands,</p>
<p>As pure I think as any gentle girl<br />Who now would turn in horror
from my hands -<br />[Stands up.]<br />You came: ah!&nbsp; Guido, the
first kindly words<br />I ever heard since I had come from France<br />Were
from your lips: well, well, that is no matter.<br />You came, and in
the passion of your eyes<br />I read love&rsquo;s meaning; everything
you said<br />Touched my dumb soul to music, so I loved you.<br />And
yet I did not tell you of my love.<br />&rsquo;Twas you who sought me
out, knelt at my feet<br />As I kneel now at yours, and with sweet vows,<br />[Kneels.]<br />Whose
music seems to linger in my ears,<br />Swore that you loved me, and
I trusted you.<br />I think there are many women in the world<br />Who
would have tempted you to kill the man.<br />I did not.<br />Yet I know
that had I done so,<br />I had not been thus humbled in the dust,<br />[Stands
up.]<br />But you had loved me very faithfully.<br />[After a pause
approaches him timidly.]<br />I do not think you understand me, Guido:<br />It
was for your sake that I wrought this deed<br />Whose horror now chills
my young blood to ice,<br />For your sake only.&nbsp; [Stretching out
her arm.]<br />Will you not speak to me?<br />Love me a little: in my
girlish life<br />I have been starved for love, and kindliness<br />Has
passed me by.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I dare not look at you:<br />You come to me with too pronounced a
favour;<br />Get to your tirewomen.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay, there it is!<br />There speaks the man! yet had you come to me<br />With
any heavy sin upon your soul,<br />Some murder done for hire, not for
love,<br />Why, I had sat and watched at your bedside<br />All through
the night-time, lest Remorse might come<br />And pour his poisons in
your ear, and so<br />Keep you from sleeping!&nbsp; Sure it is the guilty,<br />Who,
being very wretched, need love most.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>There is no love where there is any guilt.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No love where there is any guilt!&nbsp; O God,<br />How differently
do we love from men!<br />There is many a woman here in Padua,<br />Some
workman&rsquo;s wife, or ruder artisan&rsquo;s,<br />Whose husband spends
the wages of the week<br />In a coarse revel, or a tavern brawl,<br />And
reeling home late on the Saturday night,<br />Finds his wife sitting
by a fireless hearth,<br />Trying to hush the child who cries for hunger,<br />And
then sets to and beats his wife because<br />The child is hungry, and
the fire black.<br />Yet the wife loves him! and will rise next day<br />With
some red bruise across a careworn face,<br />And sweep the house, and
do the common service,<br />And try and smile, and only be too glad<br />If
he does not beat her a second time<br />Before her child! - that is
how women love.<br />[A pause: GUIDO says nothing.]<br />I think you
will not drive me from your side.<br />Where have I got to go if you
reject me? -<br />You for whose sake this hand has murdered life,<br />You
for whose sake my soul has wrecked itself<br />Beyond all hope of pardon.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Get thee gone:<br />The dead man is a ghost, and our love too,<br />Flits
like a ghost about its desolate tomb,<br />And wanders through this
charnel house, and weeps<br />That when you slew your lord you slew
it also.<br />Do you not see?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I see when men love women<br />They give them but a little of their
lives,<br />But women when they love give everything;<br />I see that,
Guido, now.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Away, away,<br />And come not back till you have waked your dead.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I would to God that I could wake the dead,<br />Put vision in the
glaz&eacute;d eves, and give<br />The tongue its natural utterance,
and bid<br />The heart to beat again: that cannot be:<br />For what
is done, is done: and what is dead<br />Is dead for ever: the fire cannot
warm him:<br />The winter cannot hurt him with its snows;<br />Something
has gone from him; if you call him now,<br />He will not answer; if
you mock him now,<br />He will not laugh; and if you stab him now<br />He
will not bleed.<br />I would that I could wake him!<br />O God, put
back the sun a little space,<br />And from the roll of time blot out
to-night,<br />And bid it not have been!&nbsp; Put back the sun,<br />And
make me what I was an hour ago!<br />No, no, time will not stop for
anything,<br />Nor the sun stay its courses, though Repentance<br />Calling
it back grow hoarse; but you, my love,<br />Have you no word of pity
even for me?<br />O Guido, Guido, will you not kiss me once?<br />Drive
me not to some desperate resolve:<br />Women grow mad when they are
treated thus:<br />Will you not kiss me once?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[holding up knife]<br />I will not kiss you<br />Until the blood
grows dry upon this knife,<br />[Wildly]&nbsp; Back to your dead!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[going up the stairs]<br />Why, then I will be gone! and may you
find<br />More mercy than you showed to me to-night!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Let me find mercy when I go at night<br />And do foul murder.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[coming down a few steps.]<br />Murder did you say?<br />Murder is
hungry, and still cries for more,<br />And Death, his brother, is not
satisfied,<br />But walks the house, and will not go away,<br />Unless
he has a comrade!&nbsp; Tarry, Death,<br />For I will give thee a most
faithful lackey<br />To travel with thee!&nbsp; Murder, call no more,<br />For
thou shalt eat thy fill.<br />There is a storm<br />Will break upon
this house before the morning,<br />So horrible, that the white moon
already<br />Turns grey and sick with terror, the low wind<br />Goes
moaning round the house, and the high stars<br />Run madly through the
vaulted firmament,<br />As though the night wept tears of liquid fire<br />For
what the day shall look upon.&nbsp; Oh, weep,<br />Thou lamentable heaven!&nbsp;
Weep thy fill!<br />Though sorrow like a cataract drench the fields,<br />And
make the earth one bitter lake of tears,<br />It would not be enough.&nbsp;
[A peal of thunder.]<br />Do you not hear,<br />There is artillery in
the Heaven to-night.<br />Vengeance is wakened up, and has unloosed<br />His
dogs upon the world, and in this matter<br />Which lies between us two,
let him who draws<br />The thunder on his head beware the ruin<br />Which
the forked flame brings after.<br />[A flash of lightning followed by
a peal of thunder.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Away! away!<br />[Exit the DUCHESS, who as she lifts the crimson
curtain looks back for a moment at GUIDO, but he makes no sign.&nbsp;
More thunder.]<br />Now is life fallen in ashes at my feet<br />And
noble love self-slain; and in its place<br />Crept murder with its silent
bloody feet.<br />And she who wrought it - Oh! and yet she loved me,<br />And
for my sake did do this dreadful thing.<br />I have been cruel to her:
Beatrice!<br />Beatrice, I say, come back.<br />[Begins to ascend staircase,
when the noise of Soldiers is heard.]<br />Ah! what is that?<br />Torches
ablaze, and noise of hurrying feet.<br />Pray God they have not seized
her.<br />[Noise grows louder.]<br />Beatrice!<br />There is yet time
to escape.&nbsp; Come down, come out!<br />[The voice of the DUCHESS
outside.]<br />This way went he, the man who slew my lord.<br />[Down
the staircase comes hurrying a confused body of Soldiers; GUIDO is not
seen at first, till the DUCHESS surrounded by Servants carrying torches
appears at the top of the staircase, and points to GUIDO, who is seized
at once, one of the Soldiers dragging the knife from his hand and showing
it to the Captain of the Guard in sight of the audience.&nbsp; Tableau.]</p>

<p>SCENE</p>
<p>The Court of Justice: the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet:
above the hangings the wall is red, and gilt symbolical figures bear
up the roof, which is made of red beams with grey soffits and moulding:
a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the Duchess: below
it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges: below that a table for
the clerks of the court.&nbsp; Two soldiers stand on each side of the
canopy, and two soldiers guard the door; the citizens have some of them
collected in the Court; others are coming in greeting one another; two
tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Good morrow, neighbour Anthony.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>This is a strange day for Padua, is it not? - the Duke being dead.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since
the last Duke died.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
neighbour Anthony?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Nay, for he might &rsquo;scape his punishment then; but they will
condemn him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
so that no injustice is done.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>They say a Duke has blue blood.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>I think our Duke&rsquo;s blood was black like his soul.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the
lashes of his eye.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, that he is a well-behaved, and a well-meaning, and a well-favoured
lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas the first time he did it: may be the law will not be
hard on him, as he did not do it before.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Silence, knave.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Here be one of the household coming.&nbsp; Well, Dame Lucy, thou
art of the Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet
face?</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>O well-a-day!&nbsp; O miserable day!&nbsp; O day!&nbsp; O misery!&nbsp;
Why it is just nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was
married to my husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered;
there is a coincidence for you!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, if it is a coincidence, they may not kill the young man: there
is no law against coincidences.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>But how does the Duchess?</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>Well well, I knew some harm would happen to the house: six weeks
ago the cakes were all burned on one side, and last Saint Martin even
as ever was, there flew into the candle a big moth that had wings, and
a&rsquo;most scared me.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>But come to the Duchess, good gossip: what of her?</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>Marry, it is time you should ask after her, poor lady; she is distraught
almost.&nbsp; Why, she has not slept, but paced the chamber all night
long.&nbsp; I prayed her to have a posset, or some aqua-vitae, and to
get to bed and sleep a little for her health&rsquo;s sake, but she answered
me she was afraid she might dream.&nbsp; That was a strange answer,
was it not?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>These great folk have not much sense, so Providence makes it up to
them in fine clothes.</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>Well, well, God keep murder from us, I say, as long as we are alive.</p>
<p>[Enter LORD MORANZONE hurriedly.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Is the Duke dead?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>He has a knife in his heart, which they say is not healthy for any
man.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Who is accused of having killed him?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, the prisoner, sir.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>But who is the prisoner?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, he that is accused of the Duke&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I mean, what is his name?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Faith, the same which his godfathers gave him: what else should it
be?</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti is his name, my lord.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>I almost knew thine answer ere you gave it.<br />[Aside.]<br />Yet
it is strange he should have killed the Duke,<br />Seeing he left me
in such different mood.<br />It is most likely when he saw the man,<br />This
devil who had sold his father&rsquo;s life,<br />That passion from their
seat within his heart<br />Thrust all his boyish theories of love,<br />And
in their place set vengeance; yet I marvel<br />That he escaped not.<br />[Turning
again to the crowd.]<br />How was he taken?&nbsp; Tell me.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Marry, sir, he was taken by the heels.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>But who seized him?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, those that did lay hold of him.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>How was the alarm given?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>That I cannot tell you, sir.</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>It was the Duchess herself who pointed him out.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[aside]<br />The Duchess!&nbsp; There is something strange in this.</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>Ay! And the dagger was in his hand - the Duchess&rsquo;s own dagger.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>MISTRESS LUCY</p>
<p>Why, marry, that it was with the Duchess&rsquo;s dagger that the
Duke was killed.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[aside]<br />There is some mystery about this: I cannot understand
it.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>They be very long a-coming,</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>I warrant they will come soon enough for the prisoner.</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Silence in the Court!</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Thou dost break silence in bidding us keep it, Master Tipstaff.<br />[Enter
the LORD JUSTICE and the other Judges.]</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Who is he in scarlet?&nbsp; Is he the headsman?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Nay, he is the Lord Justice.<br />[Enter GUIDO guarded.]</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>There be the prisoner surely.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>He looks honest.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>That be his villany: knaves nowadays do look so honest that honest
folk are forced to look like knaves so as to be different.<br />[Enter
the Headman, who takes his stand behind GUIDO.]</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Yon be the headsman then!&nbsp; O Lord!&nbsp; Is the axe sharp, think
you?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Ay! sharper than thy wits are; but the edge is not towards him, mark
you.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>[scratching his neck]<br />I&rsquo; faith, I like it not so near.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Tut, thou need&rsquo;st not be afraid; they never cut the heads of
common folk: they do but hang us.<br />[Trumpets outside.]</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>What are the trumpets for?&nbsp; Is the trial over?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Nay, &rsquo;tis for the Duchess.<br />[Enter the DUCHESS in black
velvet; her train of flowered black velvet is carried by two pages in
violet; with her is the CARDINAL in scarlet, and the gentlemen of the
Court in black; she takes her seat on the throne above the Judges, who
rise and take their caps off as she enters; the CARDINAL sits next to
her a little lower; the Courtiers group themselves about the throne.]</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>O poor lady, how pale she is!&nbsp; Will she sit there?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Ay! she is in the Duke&rsquo;s place now.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>That is a good thing for Padua; the Duchess is a very kind and merciful
Duchess; why, she cured my child of the ague once.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN</p>
<p>Ay, and has given us bread: do not forget the bread.</p>
<p>A SOLDIER</p>
<p>Stand back, good people.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>If we be good, why should we stand back?</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Silence in the Court!</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>May it please your Grace,<br />Is it your pleasure we proceed to
trial<br />Of the Duke&rsquo;s murder?&nbsp; [DUCHESS bows.]<br />Set
the prisoner forth.<br />What is thy name?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It matters not, my lord.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Guido Ferranti is thy name in Padua.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>A man may die as well under that name as any other.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Thou art not ignorant<br />What dreadful charge men lay against thee
here,<br />Namely, the treacherous murder of thy Lord,<br />Simone Gesso,
Duke of Padua;<br />What dost thou say in answer?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I say nothing.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>[rising]<br />Guido Ferranti -</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[stepping from the crowd]<br />Tarry, my Lord Justice.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Who art thou that bid&rsquo;st justice tarry, sir?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>So be it justice it can go its way;<br />But if it be not justice
-</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>COUNT BARDI</p>
<p>A very noble gentleman, and well known<br />To the late Duke.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Sir, thou art come in time<br />To see the murder of the Duke avenged.<br />There
stands the man who did this heinous thing.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>My lord,<br />I ask again what proof have ye?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>[holding up the dagger]<br />This dagger,<br />Which from his blood-stained
hands, itself all blood,<br />Last night the soldiers seized: what further
proof<br />Need we indeed?</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[takes the danger and approaches the DUCHESS]<br />Saw I not such
a dagger<br />Hang from your Grace&rsquo;s girdle yesterday?<br />[The
DUCHESS shudders and makes no answer.]<br />Ah! my Lord Justice, may
I speak a moment<br />With this young man, who in such peril stands?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Ay, willingly, my lord, and may you turn him<br />To make a full
avowal of his guilt.<br />[LORD MORANZONE goes over to GUIDO, who stands
R. and clutches him by the hand.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>[in a low voice]<br />She did it!&nbsp; Nay, I saw it in her eyes.<br />Boy,
dost thou think I&rsquo;ll let thy father&rsquo;s son<br />Be by this
woman butchered to his death?<br />Her husband sold your father, and
the wife<br />Would sell the son in turn.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Lord Moranzone,<br />I alone did this thing: be satisfied,<br />My
father is avenged.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Doth he confess?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>My lord, I do confess<br />That foul unnatural murder has been done.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>Why, look at that: he has a pitiful heart, and does not like murder;
they will let him go for that.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Say you no more?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>My lord, I say this also,<br />That to spill human blood is deadly
sin.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>Marry, he should tell that to the headsman: &rsquo;tis a good sentiment.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Lastly, my lord, I do entreat the Court<br />To give me leave to
utter openly<br />The dreadful secret of this mystery,<br />And to point
out the very guilty one<br />Who with this dagger last night slew the
Duke.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Thou hast leave to speak.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[rising]<br />I say he shall not speak:<br />What need have we of
further evidence?<br />Was he not taken in the house at night<br />In
Guilt&rsquo;s own bloody livery?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>[showing her the statute]<br />Your Grace<br />Can read the law.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[waiving book aside]<br />Bethink you, my Lord Justice,<br />Is it
not very like that such a one<br />May, in the presence of the people
here,<br />Utter some slanderous word against my Lord,<br />Against
the city, or the city&rsquo;s honour,<br />Perchance against myself.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>My liege, the law.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>He shall not speak, but, with gags in his mouth,<br />Shall climb
the ladder to the bloody block.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>The law, my liege.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>We are not bound by law,<br />But with it we bind others.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>My Lord Justice,<br />Thou wilt not suffer this injustice here.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>The Court needs not thy voice, Lord Moranzone.<br />Madam, it were
a precedent most evil<br />To wrest the law from its appointed course,<br />For,
though the cause be just, yet anarchy<br />Might on this licence touch
these golden scales<br />And unjust causes unjust victories gain.</p>
<p>COUNT BARDI</p>
<p>I do not think your Grace can stay the law.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay, it is well to preach and prate of law:<br />Methinks, my haughty
lords of Padua,<br />If ye are hurt in pocket or estate,<br />So much
as makes your monstrous revenues<br />Less by the value of one ferry
toll,<br />Ye do not wait the tedious law&rsquo;s delay<br />With such
sweet patience as ye counsel me.</p>
<p>COUNT BARDI</p>
<p>Madam, I think you wrong our nobles here.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I think I wrong them not.&nbsp; Which of you all<br />Finding a thief
within his house at night,<br />With some poor chattel thrust into his
rags,<br />Will stop and parley with him? do ye not<br />Give him unto
the officer and his hook<br />To be dragged gaolwards straightway?<br />And
so now,<br />Had ye been men, finding this fellow here,<br />With my
Lord&rsquo;s life still hot upon his hands,<br />Ye would have haled
him out into the court,<br />And struck his head off with an axe.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Speak, my Lord Justice.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Your Grace, it cannot be:<br />The laws of Padua are most certain
here:<br />And by those laws the common murderer even<br />May with
his own lips plead, and make defence.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>This is no common murderer, Lord Justice,<br />But a great outlaw,
and a most vile traitor,<br />Taken in open arms against the state.<br />For
he who slays the man who rules a state<br />Slays the state also, widows
every wife,<br />And makes each child an orphan, and no less<br />Is
to be held a public enemy,<br />Than if he came with mighty ordonnance,<br />And
all the spears of Venice at his back,<br />To beat and batter at our
city gates -<br />Nay, is more dangerous to our commonwealth,<br />For
walls and gates, bastions and forts, and things<br />Whose common elements
are wood and stone<br />May be raised up, but who can raise again<br />The
ruined body of my murdered lord,<br />And bid it live and laugh?</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>Now by Saint Paul<br />I do not think that they will let him speak.</p>
<p>JEPPO VITELLOZZO</p>
<p>There is much in this, listen.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Wherefore now,<br />Throw ashes on the head of Padua,<br />With sable
banners hang each silent street,<br />Let every man be clad in solemn
black;<br />But ere we turn to these sad rites of mourning<br />Let
us bethink us of the desperate hand<br />Which wrought and brought this
ruin on our state,<br />And straightway pack him to that narrow house,<br />Where
no voice is, but with a little dust<br />Death fills right up the lying
mouths of men.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Unhand me, knaves!&nbsp; I tell thee, my Lord Justice,<br />Thou
mightst as well bid the untrammelled ocean,<br />The winter whirlwind,
or the Alpine storm,<br />Not roar their will, as bid me hold my peace!<br />Ay!
though ye put your knives into my throat,<br />Each grim and gaping
wound shall find a tongue,<br />And cry against you.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Sir, this violence<br />Avails you nothing; for save the tribunal<br />Give
thee a lawful right to open speech,<br />Naught that thou sayest can
be credited.<br />[The DUCHESS smiles and GUIDO falls back with a gesture
of despair.]<br />Madam, myself, and these wise Justices,<br />Will
with your Grace&rsquo;s sanction now retire<br />Into another chamber,
to decide<br />Upon this difficult matter of the law,<br />And search
the statutes and the precedents.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Go, my Lord Justice, search the statutes well,<br />Nor let this
brawling traitor have his way.</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Go, my Lord Justice, search thy conscience well,<br />Nor let a man
be sent to death unheard.<br />[Exit the LORD JUSTICE and the Judges.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Silence, thou evil genius of my life!<br />Thou com&rsquo;st between
us two a second time;<br />This time, my lord, I think the turn is mine.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I shall not die till I have uttered voice.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Thou shalt die silent, and thy secret with thee.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Art thou that Beatrice, Duchess of Padua?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I am what thou hast made me; look at me well,<br />I am thy handiwork.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>See, is she not<br />Like that white tigress which we saw at Venice,<br />Sent
by some Indian soldan to the Doge?</p>
<p>JEPPO</p>
<p>Hush! she may hear thy chatter.</p>
<p>HEADSMAN</p>
<p>My young fellow,<br />I do not know why thou shouldst care to speak,<br />Seeing
my axe is close upon thy neck,<br />And words of thine will never blunt
its edge.<br />But if thou art so bent upon it, why<br />Thou mightest
plead unto the Churchman yonder:<br />The common people call him kindly
here,<br />Indeed I know he has a kindly soul.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>This man, whose trade is death, hath courtesies<br />More than the
others.</p>
<p>HEADSMAN</p>
<p>Why, God love you, sir,<br />I&rsquo;ll do you your last service
on this earth.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>My good Lord Cardinal, in a Christian land,<br />With Lord Christ&rsquo;s
face of mercy looking down<br />From the high seat of Judgment, shall
a man<br />Die unabsolved, unshrived?&nbsp; And if not so,<br />May
I not tell this dreadful tale of sin,<br />If any sin there be upon
my soul?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Thou dost but waste thy time.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>Alack, my son,<br />I have no power with the secular arm.<br />My
task begins when justice has been done,<br />To urge the wavering sinner
to repent<br />And to confess to Holy Church&rsquo;s ear<br />The dreadful
secrets of a sinful mind.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Thou mayest speak to the confessional<br />Until thy lips grow weary
of their tale,<br />But here thou shalt not speak.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>My reverend father,<br />You bring me but cold comfort.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>Nay, my son,<br />For the great power of our mother Church,<br />Ends
not with this poor bubble of a world,<br />Of which we are but dust,
as Jerome saith,<br />For if the sinner doth repentant die,<br />Our
prayers and holy masses much avail<br />To bring the guilty soul from
purgatory.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And when in purgatory thou seest my Lord<br />With that red star
of blood upon his heart,<br />Tell him I sent thee hither.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O dear God!</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>This is the woman, is it, whom you loved?</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>Your Grace is very cruel to this man.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No more than he was cruel to her Grace.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>Yet mercy is the sovereign right of princes.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I got no mercy, and I give it not.<br />He hath changed my heart
into a heart of stone,<br />He hath sown rank nettles in a goodly field,<br />He
hath poisoned the wells of pity in my breast,<br />He hath withered
up all kindness at the root;<br />My life is as some famine murdered
land,<br />Whence all good things have perished utterly:<br />I am what
he hath made me.<br />[The DUCHESS weeps.]</p>
<p>JEPPO</p>
<p>Is it not strange<br />That she should so have loved the wicked Duke?</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>It is most strange when women love their lords,<br />And when they
love them not it is most strange.</p>
<p>JEPPO</p>
<p>What a philosopher thou art, Petrucci!</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>Ay!&nbsp; I can bear the ills of other men,<br />Which is philosophy.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>They tarry long,<br />These greybeards and their council; bid them
come;<br />Bid them come quickly, else I think my heart<br />Will beat
itself to bursting: not indeed,<br />That I here care to live; God knows
my life<br />Is not so full of joy, yet, for all that,<br />I would
not die companionless, or go<br />Lonely to Hell.<br />Look, my Lord
Cardinal,<br />Canst thou not see across my forehead here,<br />In scarlet
letters writ, the word Revenge?<br />Fetch me some water, I will wash
it off:<br />&rsquo;Twas branded there last night, but in the day-time<br />I
need not wear it, need I, my Lord Cardinal?<br />Oh, how it sears and
burns into my brain:<br />Give me a knife; not that one, but another,<br />And
I will cut it out.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>It is most natural<br />To be incensed against the murderous hand<br />That
treacherously stabbed your sleeping lord.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I would, old Cardinal, I could burn that hand;<br />But it will burn
hereafter.</p>
<p>CARDINAL</p>
<p>Nay, the Church<br />Ordains us to forgive our enemies.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Forgiveness? what is that?&nbsp; I never got it.<br />They come at
last: well, my Lord Justice, well.<br />[Enter the LORD JUSTICE.]</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Most gracious Lady, and our sovereign Liege,<br />We have long pondered
on the point at issue,<br />And much considered of your Grace&rsquo;s
wisdom,<br />And never wisdom spake from fairer lips -</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Proceed, sir, without compliment.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>We find,<br />As your own Grace did rightly signify,<br />That any
citizen, who by force or craft<br />Conspires against the person of
the Liege,<br />Is <i>ipso facto</i> outlaw, void of rights<br />Such
as pertain to other citizens,<br />Is traitor, and a public enemy,<br />Who
may by any casual sword be slain<br />Without the slayer&rsquo;s danger;
nay, if brought<br />Into the presence of the tribunal,<br />Must with
dumb lips and silence reverent<br />Listen unto his well-deserved doom,<br />Nor
has the privilege of open speech.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I thank thee, my Lord Justice, heartily;<br />I like your law: and
now I pray dispatch<br />This public outlaw to his righteous doom;<br />What
is there more?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Ay, there is more, your Grace.<br />This man being alien born, not
Paduan,<br />Nor by allegiance bound unto the Duke,<br />Save such as
common nature doth lay down,<br />Hath, though accused of treasons manifold,<br />Whose
slightest penalty is certain death,<br />Yet still the right of public
utterance<br />Before the people and the open court;<br />Nay, shall
be much entreated by the Court,<br />To make some formal pleading for
his life,<br />Lest his own city, righteously incensed,<br />Should
with an unjust trial tax our state,<br />And wars spring up against
the commonwealth:<br />So merciful are the laws of Padua<br />Unto the
stranger living in her gates.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Being of my Lord&rsquo;s household, is he stranger here?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Ay, until seven years of service spent<br />He cannot be a Paduan
citizen.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I thank thee, my Lord Justice, heartily;<br />I like your law.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN</p>
<p>I like no law at all:<br />Were there no law there&rsquo;d be no
law-breakers,<br />So all men would be virtuous.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN</p>
<p>So they would;<br />&rsquo;Tis a wise saying that, and brings you
far.</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Ay! to the gallows, knave.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Is this the law?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>It is the law most certainly, my liege.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Show me the book: &rsquo;tis written in blood-red.</p>
<p>JEPPO</p>
<p>Look at the Duchess.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Thou accursed law,<br />I would that I could tear thee from the state<br />As
easy as I tear thee from this book.<br />[Tears out the page.]<br />Come
here, Count Bardi: are you honourable?<br />Get a horse ready for me
at my house,<br />For I must ride to Venice instantly.</p>
<p>BARDI</p>
<p>To Venice, Madam?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Not a word of this,<br />Go, go at once.&nbsp; [Exit COUNT BARDI.]<br />A
moment, my Lord Justice.<br />If, as thou sayest it, this is the law
-<br />Nay, nay, I doubt not that thou sayest right,<br />Though right
be wrong in such a case as this -<br />May I not by the virtue of mine
office<br />Adjourn this court until another day?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Madam, you cannot stay a trial for blood.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I will not tarry then to hear this man<br />Rail with rude tongue
against our sacred person.<br />Come, gentlemen.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>My liege,<br />You cannot leave this court until the prisoner<br />Be
purged or guilty of this dread offence.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Cannot, Lord Justice?&nbsp; By what right do you<br />Set barriers
in my path where I should go?<br />Am I not Duchess here in Padua,<br />And
the state&rsquo;s regent?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>For that reason, Madam,<br />Being the fountain-head of life and
death<br />Whence, like a mighty river, justice flows,<br />Without
thy presence justice is dried up<br />And fails of purpose: thou must
tarry here.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What, wilt thou keep me here against my will?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>We pray thy will be not against the law.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>What if I force my way out of the court?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Thou canst not force the Court to give thee way.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I will not tarry.&nbsp; [Rises from her seat.]</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Is the usher here?<br />Let him stand forth.&nbsp; [Usher comes forward.]<br />Thou
knowest thy business, sir.<br />[The Usher closes the doors of the court,
which are L., and when the DUCHESS and her retinue approach, kneels
down.]</p>
<p>USHER</p>
<p>In all humility I beseech your Grace<br />Turn not my duty to discourtesy,<br />Nor
make my unwelcome office an offence.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Is there no gentleman amongst you all<br />To prick this prating
fellow from our way?</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>[drawing his sword]<br />Ay! that will I.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Count Maffio, have a care,<br />And you, sir.&nbsp; [To JEPPO.]<br />The
first man who draws his sword<br />Upon the meanest officer of this
Court,<br />Dies before nightfall.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Sirs, put up your swords:<br />It is most meet that I should hear
this man.<br />[Goes back to throne.]</p>
<p>MORANZONE</p>
<p>Now hast thou got thy enemy in thy hand.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>[taking the time-glass up]<br />Guido Ferranti, while the crumbling
sand<br />Falls through this time-glass, thou hast leave to speak.<br />This
and no more.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It is enough, my lord.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Thou standest on the extreme verge of death;<br />See that thou speakest
nothing but the truth,<br />Naught else will serve thee.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>If I speak it not,<br />Then give my body to the headsman there.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>[turns the time-glass]<br />Let there be silence while the prisoner
speaks.</p>
<p>TIPSTAFF</p>
<p>Silence in the Court there.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>My Lords Justices,<br />And reverent judges of this worthy court,<br />I
hardly know where to begin my tale,<br />So strangely dreadful is this
history.<br />First, let me tell you of what birth I am.<br />I am the
son of that good Duke Lorenzo<br />Who was with damned treachery done
to death<br />By a most wicked villain, lately Duke<br />Of this good
town of Padua.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Have a care,<br />It will avail thee nought to mock this prince<br />Who
now lies in his coffin.</p>
<p>MAFFIO</p>
<p>By Saint James,<br />This is the Duke of Parma&rsquo;s rightful heir.</p>
<p>JEPPO</p>
<p>I always thought him noble.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I confess<br />That with the purport of a just revenge,<br />A most
just vengeance on a man of blood,<br />I entered the Duke&rsquo;s household,
served his will,<br />Sat at his board, drank of his wine, and was<br />His
intimate: so much I will confess,<br />And this too, that I waited till
he grew<br />To give the fondest secrets of his life<br />Into my keeping,
till he fawned on me,<br />And trusted me in every private matter<br />Even
as my noble father trusted him;<br />That for this thing I waited.<br />[To
the Headsman.]&nbsp; Thou man of blood!<br />Turn not thine axe on me
before the time:<br />Who knows if it be time for me to die?<br />Is
there no other neck in court but mine?</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>The sand within the time-glass flows apace.<br />Come quickly to
the murder of the Duke.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I will be brief: Last night at twelve o&rsquo; the clock,<br />By
a strong rope I scaled the palace wall,<br />With purport to revenge
my father&rsquo;s murder -<br />Ay! with that purport I confess, my
lord.<br />This much I will acknowledge, and this also,<br />That as
with stealthy feet I climbed the stair<br />Which led unto the chamber
of the Duke,<br />And reached my hand out for the scarlet cloth<br />Which
shook and shivered in the gusty door,<br />Lo! the white moon that sailed
in the great heaven<br />Flooded with silver light the darkened room,<br />Night
lit her candles for me, and I saw<br />The man I hated, cursing in his
sleep;<br />And thinking of a most dear father murdered,<br />Sold to
the scaffold, bartered to the block,<br />I smote the treacherous villain
to the heart<br />With this same dagger, which by chance I found<br />Within
the chamber.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[rising from her seat]<br />Oh!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[hurriedly]<br />I killed the Duke.<br />Now, my Lord Justice, if
I may crave a boon,<br />Suffer me not to see another sun<br />Light
up the misery of this loathsome world.</p>
<p>LORD JUSTICE</p>
<p>Thy boon is granted, thou shalt die to-night.<br />Lead him away.&nbsp;
Come, Madam<br />[GUIDO is led off; as he goes the DUCHESS stretches
out her arms and rushes down the stage.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Guido!&nbsp; Guido!<br />[Faints.]</p>
<p>Tableau</p>
<p>END OF ACT IV.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ACT V</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>SCENE</p>
<p>A dungeon in the public prison of Padua; Guido lies asleep on a pallet
(L.C.); a table with a goblet on it is set (L.C.); five soldiers are
drinking and playing dice in the corner on a stone table; one of them
has a lantern hung to his halbert; a torch is set in the wall over Guido&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; Two grated windows behind, one on each side of the door
which is (C.), look out into the passage; the stage is rather dark.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>[throws dice]<br />Sixes again! good Pietro.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>I&rsquo; faith, lieutenant, I will play with thee no more.&nbsp;
I will lose everything.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>Except thy wits; thou art safe there!</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>Ay, ay, he cannot take them from me.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>No; for thou hast no wits to give him.</p>
<p>THE SOLDIERS</p>
<p>[loudly]<br />Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Silence!&nbsp; You will wake the prisoner; he is asleep.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>What matter?&nbsp; He will get sleep enough when he is buried.&nbsp;
I warrant he&rsquo;d be glad if we could wake him when he&rsquo;s in
the grave.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one
of us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes
being near against the law.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked
people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>Ay, that is true.&nbsp; How old is the prisoner?</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Why, then, he might be any age.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely.</p>
<p>THE SOLDIERS</p>
<p>Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything.</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER</p>
<p>Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see
that justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his
head is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there
is no law against that.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business
for him after all.&nbsp; This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the
law can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure.</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>And if he does not drink it?</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Why, then, they will kill him.<br />[Knocking comes at the door.]</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>See who that is.<br />[Third Soldier goes over and looks through
the wicket.]</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>It is a woman, sir.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Is she pretty?</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; She is masked, lieutenant.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>It is only very ugly or very beautiful women who ever hide their
faces.&nbsp; Let her in.<br />[Soldier opens the door, and the DUCHESS
masked and cloaked enters.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[to Third Soldier]<br />Are you the officer on guard?</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>[coming forward]<br />I am, madam.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I must see the prisoner alone.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>I am afraid that is impossible.&nbsp; [The DUCHESS hands him a ring,
he looks at and returns it to her with a bow and makes a sign to the
Soldiers.]&nbsp; Stand without there.&nbsp; [Exeunt the Soldiers.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Officer, your men are somewhat rough.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>They mean no harm.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I shall be going back in a few minutes.&nbsp; As I pass through the
corridor do not let them try and lift my mask.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>You need not be afraid, madam.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>I have a particular reason for wishing my face not to be seen.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Madam, with this ring you can go in and out as you please; it is
the Duchess&rsquo;s own ring.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Leave us.&nbsp; [The Soldier turns to go out.]&nbsp; A moment, sir.&nbsp;
For what hour is . . .</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock, madam, we have orders to lead him out; but
I dare say he won&rsquo;t wait for us; he&rsquo;s more like to take
a drink out of that poison yonder.&nbsp; Men are afraid of the headsman.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Is that poison?</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>Ay, madam, and very sure poison too.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>You may go, sir.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER</p>
<p>By Saint James, a pretty hand!&nbsp; I wonder who she is.&nbsp; Some
woman who loved him, perhaps.&nbsp; [Exit.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[taking her mark off]&nbsp; At last!<br />He can escape now in this
cloak and vizard,<br />We are of a height almost: they will not know
him;<br />As for myself what matter?<br />So that he does not curse
me as he goes,<br />I care but little: I wonder will he curse me.<br />He
has the right.&nbsp; It is eleven now;<br />They will not come till
twelve.<br />[Goes over to the table.]<br />So this is poison.<br />Is
it not strange that in this liquor here<br />There lies the key to all
philosophies?<br />[Takes the cup up.]<br />It smells of poppies.&nbsp;
I remember well<br />That, when I was a child in Sicily,<br />I took
the scarlet poppies from the corn,<br />And made a little wreath, and
my grave uncle,<br />Don John of Naples, laughed: I did not know<br />That
they had power to stay the springs of life,<br />To make the pulse cease
beating, and to chill<br />The blood in its own vessels, till men come<br />And
with a hook hale the poor body out,<br />And throw it in a ditch: the
body, ay, -<br />What of the soul? that goes to heaven or hell.<br />Where
will mine go?<br />[Takes the torch from the wall, and goes over to
the bed.]<br />How peacefully here he sleeps,<br />Like a young schoolboy
tired out with play:<br />I would that I could sleep so peacefully,<br />But
I have dreams.&nbsp; [Bending over him.]<br />Poor boy: what if I kissed
him?<br />No, no, my lips would burn him like a fire.<br />He has had
enough of Love.&nbsp; Still that white neck<br />Will &rsquo;scape the
headsman: I have seen to that:<br />He will get hence from Padua to-night,<br />And
that is well.&nbsp; You are very wise, Lord Justices,<br />And yet you
are not half so wise as I am,<br />And that is well.<br />O God! how
I have loved you,<br />And what a bloody flower did Love bear!<br />[Comes
back to the table.]<br />What if I drank these juices, and so ceased?<br />Were
it not better than to wait till Death<br />Come to my bed with all his
serving men,<br />Remorse, disease, old age, and misery?<br />I wonder
does one suffer much: I think<br />That I am very young to die like
this,<br />But so it must be.&nbsp; Why, why should I die?<br />He will
escape to-night, and so his blood<br />Will not be on my head.&nbsp;
No, I must die;<br />I have been guilty, therefore I must die;<br />He
loves me not, and therefore I must die:<br />I would die happier if
he would kiss me,<br />But he will not do that.&nbsp; I did not know
him.<br />I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge;<br />That is not
strange; we women never know<br />Our lovers till they leave us.<br />[Bell
begins to toll]<br />Thou vile bell,<br />That like a bloodhound from
thy brazen throat<br />Call&rsquo;st for this man&rsquo;s life, cease!
thou shalt not get it.<br />He stirs - I must be quick:&nbsp; [Takes
up cup.]<br />O Love, Love, Love,<br />I did not think that I would
pledge thee thus!<br />[Drinks poison, and sets the cup down on the
table behind her: the noise wakens GUIDO, who starts up, and does not
see what she has done.&nbsp; There is silence for a minute, each looking
at the other.]<br />I do not come to ask your pardon now,<br />Seeing
I know I stand beyond all pardon;<br />Enough of that: I have already,
sir,<br />Confessed my sin to the Lords Justices;<br />They would not
listen to me: and some said<br />I did invent a tale to save your life;<br />You
have trafficked with me; others said<br />That women played with pity
as with men;<br />Others that grief for my slain Lord and husband<br />Had
robbed me of my wits: they would not hear me,<br />And, when I sware
it on the holy book,<br />They bade the doctor cure me.&nbsp; They are
ten,<br />Ten against one, and they possess your life.<br />They call
me Duchess here in Padua.<br />I do not know, sir; if I be the Duchess,<br />I
wrote your pardon, and they would not take it;<br />They call it treason,
say I taught them that;<br />Maybe I did.&nbsp; Within an hour, Guido,<br />They
will be here, and drag you from the cell,<br />And bind your hands behind
your back, and bid you<br />Kneel at the block: I am before them there;<br />Here
is the signet ring of Padua,<br />&rsquo;Twill bring you safely through
the men on guard;<br />There is my cloak and vizard; they have orders<br />Not
to be curious: when you pass the gate<br />Turn to the left, and at
the second bridge<br />You will find horses waiting: by to-morrow<br />You
will be at Venice, safe.&nbsp; [A pause.]<br />Do you not speak?<br />Will
you not even curse me ere you go? -<br />You have the right.&nbsp; [A
pause.]<br />You do not understand<br />There lies between you and the
headsman&rsquo;s axe<br />Hardly so much sand in the hour-glass<br />As
a child&rsquo;s palm could carry: here is the ring:<br />I have washed
my hand: there is no blood upon it:<br />You need not fear.&nbsp; Will
you not take the ring?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[takes ring and kisses it]<br />Ay! gladly, Madam.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And leave Padua.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Leave Padua.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>But it must be to-night.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>To-night it shall be.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Oh, thank God for that!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>So I can live; life never seemed so sweet<br />As at this moment.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Do not tarry, Guido,<br />There is my cloak: the horse is at the
bridge,<br />The second bridge below the ferry house:<br />Why do you
tarry?&nbsp; Can your ears not hear<br />This dreadful bell, whose every
ringing stroke<br />Robs one brief minute from your boyish life.<br />Go
quickly.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ay! he will come soon enough.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[calmly]<br />Why, the headsman.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Only he<br />Can bring me out of Padua.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>You dare not!<br />You dare not burden my o&rsquo;erburdened soul<br />With
two dead men!&nbsp; I think one is enough.<br />For when I stand before
God, face to face,<br />I would not have you, with a scarlet thread<br />Around
your white throat, coming up behind<br />To say I did it.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Madam, I wait.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, no, you cannot: you do not understand,<br />I have less power
in Padua to-night<br />Than any common woman; they will kill you.<br />I
saw the scaffold as I crossed the square,<br />Already the low rabble
throng about it<br />With fearful jests, and horrid merriment,<br />As
though it were a morris-dancer&rsquo;s platform,<br />And not Death&rsquo;s
sable throne.&nbsp; O Guido, Guido,<br />You must escape!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Madam, I tarry here.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Guido, you shall not: it would be a thing<br />So terrible that the
amazed stars<br />Would fall from heaven, and the palsied moon<br />Be
in her sphere eclipsed, and the great sun<br />Refuse to shine upon
the unjust earth<br />Which saw thee die.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Be sure I shall not stir.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[wringing her hands]<br />Is one sin not enough, but must it breed<br />A
second sin more horrible again<br />Than was the one that bare it?&nbsp;
O God, God,<br />Seal up sin&rsquo;s teeming womb, and make it barren,<br />I
will not have more blood upon my hand<br />Than I have now.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[seizing her hand]<br />What! am I fallen so low<br />That I may
not have leave to die for you?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[tearing her hand away]<br />Die for me? - no, my life is a vile
thing,<br />Thrown to the miry highways of this world;<br />You shall
not die for me, you shall not, Guido;<br />I am a guilty woman.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Guilty? - let those<br />Who know what a thing temptation is,<br />Let
those who have not walked as we have done,<br />In the red fire of passion,
those whose lives<br />Are dull and colourless, in a word let those,<br />If
any such there be, who have not loved,<br />Cast stones against you.&nbsp;
As for me -</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[falling at her feet]<br />You are my lady, and you are my love!<br />O
hair of gold, O crimson lips, O face<br />Made for the luring and the
love of man!<br />Incarnate image of pure loveliness!<br />Worshipping
thee I do forget the past,<br />Worshipping thee my soul comes close
to thine,<br />Worshipping thee I seem to be a god,<br />And though
they give my body to the block,<br />Yet is my love eternal!<br />[DUCHESS
puts her hands over her face: GUIDO draws them down.]<br />Sweet, lift
up<br />The trailing curtains that overhang your eyes<br />That I may
look into those eyes, and tell you<br />I love you, never more than
now when Death<br />Thrusts his cold lips between us: Beatrice,<br />I
love you: have you no word left to say?<br />Oh, I can bear the executioner,<br />But
not this silence: will you not say you love me?<br />Speak but that
word and Death shall lose his sting,<br />But speak it not, and fifty
thousand deaths<br />Are, in comparison, mercy.&nbsp; Oh, you are cruel,<br />And
do not love me.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; I have no right<br />For I have stained the innocent
hands of love<br />With spilt-out blood: there is blood on the ground;<br />I
set it there.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Sweet, it was not yourself,<br />It was some devil tempted you.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[rising suddenly]<br />No, no,<br />We are each our own devil, and
we make<br />This world our hell.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Then let high Paradise<br />Fall into Tartarus! for I shall make<br />This
world my heaven for a little space.<br />The sin was mine, if any sin
there was.<br />&rsquo;Twas I who nurtured murder in my heart,<br />Sweetened
my meats, seasoned my wine with it,<br />And in my fancy slew the accursed
Duke<br />A hundred times a day.&nbsp; Why, had this man<br />Died half
so often as I wished him to,<br />Death had been stalking ever through
the house,<br />And murder had not slept.<br />But you, fond heart,<br />Whose
little eyes grew tender over a whipt hound,<br />You whom the little
children laughed to see<br />Because you brought the sunlight where
you passed,<br />You the white angel of God&rsquo;s purity,<br />This
which men call your sin, what was it?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Ay!<br />What was it?&nbsp; There are times it seems a dream,<br />An
evil dream sent by an evil god,<br />And then I see the dead face in
the coffin<br />And know it is no dream, but that my hand<br />Is red
with blood, and that my desperate soul<br />Striving to find some haven
for its love<br />From the wild tempest of this raging world,<br />Has
wrecked its bark upon the rocks of sin.<br />What was it, said you?
- murder merely?&nbsp; Nothing<br />But murder, horrible murder.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Nay, nay, nay,<br />&rsquo;Twas but the passion-flower of your love<br />That
in one moment leapt to terrible life,<br />And in one moment bare this
gory fruit,<br />Which I had plucked in thought a thousand times.<br />My
soul was murderous, but my hand refused;<br />Your hand wrought murder,
but your soul was pure.<br />And so I love you, Beatrice, and let him<br />Who
has no mercy for your stricken head,<br />Lack mercy up in heaven!&nbsp;
Kiss me, sweet.<br />[Tries to kiss her.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, no, your lips are pure, and mine are soiled,<br />For Guilt has
been my paramour, and Sin<br />Lain in my bed: O Guido, if you love
me<br />Get hence, for every moment is a worm<br />Which gnaws your
life away: nay, sweet, get hence,<br />And if in after time you think
of me,<br />Think of me as of one who loved you more<br />Than anything
on earth; think of me, Guido,<br />As of a woman merely, one who tried<br />To
make her life a sacrifice to love,<br />And slew love in the trial:
Oh, what is that?<br />The bell has stopped from ringing, and I hear<br />The
feet of armed men upon the stair.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>[aside]<br />That is the signal for the guard to come.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Why has the bell stopped ringing?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>If you must know,<br />That stops my life on this side of the grave,<br />But
on the other we shall meet again.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, no, &rsquo;tis not too late: you must get hence;<br />The horse
is by the bridge, there is still time.<br />Away, away, you must not
tarry here!<br />[Noise of Soldiers in the passage.]</p>
<p>A VOICE OUTSIDE</p>
<p>Room for the Lord Justice of Padua!<br />[The LORD JUSTICE is seen
through the grated window passing down the corridor preceded by men
bearing torches.]</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>It is too late.</p>
<p>A VOICE OUTSIDE</p>
<p>Room for the headsman.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[sinks down]<br />Oh!<br />[The Headsman with his axe on his shoulder
is seen passing the corridor, followed by Monks bearing candles.]</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Farewell, dear love, for I must drink this poison.<br />I do not
fear the headsman, but I would die<br />Not on the lonely scaffold.<br />But
here,<br />Here in thine arms, kissing thy mouth: farewell!<br />[Goes
to the table and takes the goblet up.]&nbsp; What, art thou empty?<br />[Throws
it to the ground.]<br />O thou churlish gaoler,<br />Even of poisons
niggard!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>[faintly]<br />Blame him not.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God! you have not drunk it, Beatrice?<br />Tell me you have not?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Were I to deny it,<br />There is a fire eating at my heart<br />Which
would find utterance.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O treacherous love,<br />Why have you not left a drop for me?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, no, it held but death enough for one.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Is there no poison still upon your lips,<br />That I may draw it
from them?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Why should you die?<br />You have not spilt blood, and so need not
die:<br />I have spilt blood, and therefore I must die.<br />Was it
not said blood should be spilt for blood?<br />Who said that?&nbsp;
I forget.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Tarry for me,<br />Our souls will go together.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Nay, you must live.<br />There are many other women in the world<br />Who
will love you, and not murder for your sake.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I love you only.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>You need not die for that.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ah, if we die together, love, why then<br />Can we not lie together
in one grave?</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>A grave is but a narrow wedding-bed.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>It is enough for us</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>And they will strew it<br />With a stark winding-sheet, and bitter
herbs:<br />I think there are no roses in the grave,<br />Or if there
are, they all are withered now<br />Since my Lord went there.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Ah! dear Beatrice,<br />Your lips are roses that death cannot wither.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Nay, if we lie together, will not my lips<br />Fall into dust, and
your enamoured eyes<br />Shrivel to sightless sockets, and the worms,<br />Which
are our groomsmen, eat away your heart?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I do not care: Death has no power on love.<br />And so by Love&rsquo;s
immortal sovereignty<br />I will die with you.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>But the grave is black,<br />And the pit black, so I must go before<br />To
light the candles for your coming hither.<br />No, no, I will not die,
I will not die.<br />Love, you are strong, and young, and very brave;<br />Stand
between me and the angel of death,<br />And wrestle with him for me.<br />[Thrusts
GUIDO in front of her with his back to the audience.]<br />I will kiss
you,<br />When you have thrown him.&nbsp; Oh, have you no cordial,<br />To
stay the workings of this poison in me?<br />Are there no rivers left
in Italy<br />That you will not fetch me one cup of water<br />To quench
this fire?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O God!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>You did not tell me<br />There was a drought in Italy, and no water:<br />Nothing
but fire.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O Love!</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Send for a leech,<br />Not him who stanched my husband, but another<br />We
have no time: send for a leech, I say:<br />There is an antidote against
each poison,<br />And he will sell it if we give him money.<br />Tell
him that I will give him Padua,<br />For one short hour of life: I will
not die.<br />Oh, I am sick to death; no, do not touch me,<br />This
poison gnaws my heart: I did not know<br />It was such pain to die:
I thought that life<br />Had taken all the agonies to itself;<br />It
seems it is not so.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>O damn&eacute;d stars<br />Quench your vile cresset-lights in tears,
and bid<br />The moon, your mistress, shine no more to-night.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Guido, why are we here?&nbsp; I think this room<br />Is poorly furnished
for a marriage chamber.<br />Let us get hence at once.&nbsp; Where are
the horses?<br />We should be on our way to Venice now.<br />How cold
the night is!&nbsp; We must ride faster.<br />[The Monks begin to chant
outside.]<br />Music!&nbsp; It should be merrier; but grief<br />Is
of the fashion now - I know not why.<br />You must not weep: do we not
love each other? -<br />That is enough.&nbsp; Death, what do you here?<br />You
were not bidden to this table, sir;<br />Away, we have no need of you:
I tell you<br />It was in wine I pledged you, not in poison.<br />They
lied who told you that I drank your poison.<br />It was spilt upon the
ground, like my Lord&rsquo;s blood;<br />You came too late.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>Sweet, there is nothing there:<br />These things are only unreal
shadows.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Death,<br />Why do you tarry, get to the upper chamber;<br />The
cold meats of my husband&rsquo;s funeral feast<br />Are set for you;
this is a wedding feast.<br />You are out of place, sir; and, besides,
&rsquo;tis summer.<br />We do not need these heavy fires now,<br />You
scorch us.<br />Oh, I am burned up,<br />Can you do nothing?&nbsp; Water,
give me water,<br />Or else more poison.&nbsp; No: I feel no pain -<br />Is
it not curious I should feel no pain? -<br />And Death has gone away,
I am glad of that.<br />I thought he meant to part us.&nbsp; Tell me,
Guido,<br />Are you not sorry that you ever saw me?</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>I swear I would not have lived otherwise.<br />Why, in this dull
and common world of ours<br />Men have died looking for such moments
as this<br />And have not found them.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Then you are not sorry?<br />How strange that seems.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>What, Beatrice, have I not<br />Stood face to face with beauty?&nbsp;
That is enough<br />For one man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Why, love, I could
be merry;<br />I have been often sadder at a feast,<br />But who were
sad at such a feast as this<br />When Love and Death are both our cup-bearers?<br />We
love and die together.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>Oh, I have been<br />Guilty beyond all women, and indeed<br />Beyond
all women punished.&nbsp; Do you think -<br />No, that could not be
- Oh, do you think that love<br />Can wipe the bloody stain from off
my hands,<br />Pour balm into my wounds, heal up my hurts,<br />And
wash my scarlet sins as white as snow? -<br />For I have sinned.</p>
<p>GUIDO</p>
<p>They do not sin at all<br />Who sin for love.</p>
<p>DUCHESS</p>
<p>No, I have sinned, and yet<br />Perchance my sin will be forgiven
me.<br />I have loved much</p>
<p>[They kiss each other now for the first time in this Act, when suddenly
the DUCHESS leaps up in the dreadful spasm of death, tears in agony
at her dress, and finally, with face twisted and distorted with pain,
falls back dead in a chair.&nbsp; GUIDO seizing her dagger from her
belt, kills himself; and, as he falls across her knees, clutches at
the cloak which is on the back of the chair, and throws it entirely
over her.&nbsp; There is a little pause.&nbsp; Then down the passage
comes the tramp of Soldiers; the door is opened, and the LORD JUSTICE,
the Headsman, and the Guard enter and see this figure shrouded in black,
and GUIDO lying dead across her.&nbsp; The LORD JUSTICE rushes forward
and drags the cloak off the DUCHESS, whose face is now the marble image
of peace, the sign of God&rsquo;s forgiveness.]</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright

distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
